REST was designed to be a more straightforward and easy to implement alternative to heavyweight SOAP for web service access. SOAP functions well in distributed environments where REST assumes a direct point to point communication. Also, SOAP allows for services to describe themselves to clients and in some languages allows for automation. On the other hand, REST is fast as less processing is required, uses less bandwidth and is closer to technologies used in web design. The choice on which to use is totally dependent on what the requirement. For example, SOAP is a better choice for applications that have complex API so as to describe the services and methods, where formal contracts are agreed for the exchange format, where a guaranteed level of security is required etc. REST will be preferred when limiting bandwidth and resources, when operations are can be stateless and the information can be cached. baeldung.com: REST vs SOAP REST vs OpenAPI vs gRPC REST vs. gRPC: Battle of the APIs Comparing OpenAPI With gRPC \ud83c\udf1f OpenAPI is a great choice due to its interoperability.

Crunchy Data Postgres Operator in OpenShift 4. Overview & Proof of Concept In earlier days, Red Hat recommended running PostgreSQL database outside the Kubernetes cluster. Now, with Kubernetes Operator technology, you can run stateful database applications on Kubernetes. Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator extends Kubernetes to give you the power to easily create, configure and manage PostgreSQL clusters at scale. When combined with the Crunchy PostgreSQL Container Suite , the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator provides an open source software solution for PostgreSQL scaling, high-availability, disaster recovery, monitoring, and more. All of this capability comes with the repeatability and automation that comes from Operators on Kubernetes. Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator is open source and developed in close collaboration with users to support enterprise deployments of cloud agnostic PostgreSQL-as-a-Service capability. This release comes after extensive feedback from our customers and the community to ensure the scalability and security that sysadmins, DBAs, and developers have come to rely on. Crunchy PostgreSQL and Openshift Crunchy Postgres Solutions: Postgres Operator Community Edition : \u2018pgo\u2019 CLI tool Not certified by Red Hat The Operator can be deployed by multiple methods including: The PostgreSQL Operator Installer with kubectl Install Operator Using Bash (the one used in this overview) Ansible playbook installation CLI installation using OLM (Deprecated) : new CatalogSource added via \u201cpgo.catalogsource.yaml\u201d. Openshift Console installation using OLM (OperatorHub): New CatalogSource requirement. CLI settings required. Certified Crunchydata Postgres Operator (OLM/OperatorHub): Openshift Console installation using OLM (OperatorHub): One-click deployment and Web based operation No \u2018pgo\u2019 CLI tool? (compatibility issues: unable to find in github the version that matches the server API - Sept 2019) Certified by Red Hat Provided by CrunchyData Other non-certified installations (unsupported by Red Hat): with or without OLM, CLI, etc. Crunchy Containers Community Edition : Installation: Installation guide Pgadmin4 install (easy) Not certified by Red Hat Crunchydata Postgres Operator 3.5 Release date: Januay 2019 pgBackRest Architecture Enhancements pgBackRest Point-In-Time-Recovery Fast Failover Archive Storage Configuration Preferred Failover Node Label pgo-scheduler Crunchydata Postgres Operator 4.0.1 Release date: June 2019 Namespace Deployment Options: Ability to deploy the operator its own namespace but manage PostgreSQL clusters in multiple namespace. The new namespace management features lets users create multi-tenant PostgreSQL environments that add further isolation and security to their deployments. Further Enhancements to pgBackRest Integration: Perform pgBackRest backups to Amazon S3 . This allows users to create an automated, geographically distributed, and hybrid cloud disaster recovery strategy. Integrated PostgreSQL Benchmarking Ansible Playbook Based Installation Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM): The OLM project is a component of the Operator Framework, an open source toolkit to manage Operators, in an effective, automated, and scalable way. OLM concepts were included into Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to assist in the deployment on Kubernetes using OLM integration. Crunchydata Postgres Operator 4.0.1 Community Edition Service Accounts Service accounts give us flexibility to control access to API without sharing user\u2019s credentials. Service Accounts are also used by pods and other non-human actors to perform various actions and are a central vehicle by which their access to resources is managed. By default, three service accounts are created in each project: Builder: Used by build pods and assigned the system:image-builder role, which grants push capability into the internal registry to any image stream in the project. Deployer: Used by deploy pods and assigned the system:deployer role , which allows modifying replication controllers in the project. Default: Used by all other pods by default. You can see them by running the following command: oc get serviceaccounts oc get sa Running a Pod with a Different Service Account. You can run a pod with a service account other than the default: Edit the deployment configuration: $ oc edit dc/<deployment_config> Add the serviceAccount and serviceAccountName parameters to the spec field, and specify the service account you want to use: spec: securityContext: {} serviceAccount: <service_account> serviceAccountName: <service_account> Refs: ref1 ref2 ref3 Each service account is represented by the ServiceAccount resource and is associated with two additional secrets for access to the OpenShift API and the internal registry: $ oc describe serviceaccounts/default Name: default Namespace: pgouser1 Labels: <none> Annotations: <none> Image pull secrets: default-dockercfg-nrhwt Mountable secrets: default-token-vm8b5 default-dockercfg-nrhwt Tokens: default-token-p6rhz default-token-vm8b5 Events: <none> The service account can be created and deleted with a simple command: oc create sa myserviceaccount oc delete sa/myserviceaccount Every service account is also a member of two groups: system:serviceaccounts , which includes all service accounts in the cluster system:serviceaccounts:<project> , which includes all service accounts in the project Roles assigned to Service Accounts When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same namespace. If you get the raw json or yaml for a pod you have created (e.g. oc get pods/podname -o yaml ), you can see the spec.serviceAccountName field has been automatically set. You can grant privileges to groups of service accounts, which will effectively grant those privileges to all accounts in the group: $ oc adm policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n myproject role \"view\" added: \"system:serviceaccounts\" For example, to grant view privileges to all service accounts in the cluster in the project myproject: $ oc adm policy remove-role-from-group view system:serviceaccounts \u2013n myproject role \"view\" removed: \"system:serviceaccounts\" Security Context Constraints (SCC) Security Context Constraints (SCCs) control what actions pods can perform and what resources they can access. SCCs combine a set of security configurations into a single policy object that can be applied to pods. These security configurations include, but are not limited to, Linux Capabilities, Seccomp Profiles, User and Group ID Ranges, and types of mounts. OpenShift ships with several SCCs: The most constrained is the restricted SCC , and the least constrained is the privileged SCC : oc edit scc restricted oc edit scc privileged The other SCCs provide intermediate levels of constraint for various use cases. The restricted SCC is granted to all authenticated users by default. The default SCC for most pods should be the restricted SCC. If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different SCCs . Pods should be run with the most restrictive SCC possible. Pods inherit their SCC from the Service Account used to run the pod . With the default project template, new projects get a Service Account named default that is used to run pods. This default service account is only granted the ability to run the restricted SCC. SCC Recommendations Use OpenShift\u2019s Security Context Constraint feature, which has been contributed to Kubernetes as Pod Security Policies (PSP) . PSPs are still beta in Kubernetes 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15 . Use the restricted SCC as the default For pods that require additional access, use the SCC that grants the least amount of additional privileges or create a custom SCC Remediation: Apply the SCC with the least privilege required Audit: To show all available SCCs: oc describe scc To audit a single pod: oc describe pod <POD> | grep openshift.io\\/scc openshift.io/scc: restricted Problem: Default SCC is \u201crestricted\u201d SCC -> Crunchydata Postgres Cluster PODs are not rolled out oc get rs : oc describe rs mycluster5-lgyb-84b58f5dd9 : Warning FailedCreate 3m24s (x17 over 7m30s) replicaset-controller Error creating: pods \u201cmycluster5-lgyb-84b58f5dd9-\u201d is forbidden: unable to validate against any security context constraint: [fsGroup: Invalid value: []int64{26}: 26 is not an allowed group] Add a SCC to a Project SCCs are not granted directly to a project. Instead, you add a service account to an SCC and either specify the service account name on your pod or, when unspecified, run as the default service account. To add a SCC to a user: oc adm policy add-scc-to-group <scc_name> <group_name> To add a SCC to all service accounts in a namespace: oc adm policy add-scc-to-group <scc_name> system:serviceaccounts:<serviceaccount_namespace> If you are currently in the project to which the service account belongs, you can use the -z flag and just specify the serviceaccount_name : oc adm policy add-scc-to-user <scc_name> -z <serviceaccount_name> Examples: oc describe scc anyuid oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts:pgouser1 \u2018default\u2019 serviceAccount: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccounts:pgouser1:default User registered in Identity Provider: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid myuser Custom serviceAccount: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccounts:pgouser1:my-sa Refs: ref1 ref2 ref3 \ud83c\udf1f Workflow1 without custom Service Account and without DeploymentConfig Workflow2 with custom Service Account and without DeploymentConfig Create a custom ServiceAccount and add a role to it within a Project: oc project pgouser1 oc get scc oc create serviceaccount my-sa \u2013n pgouser1 oc describe sa my-sa oc get scc oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:pgouser1:my-sa oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:pgouser1:my-sa Alternative to step #6: oc edit scc anyuid users: - system:serviceaccount:pgouser1:my-sa Other commands of interest: oc get role oc describe role pgo-role oc edit role pgo-role References: ref1 ref2 ref3 Workflow3 with custom service Account and DeploymentConfig Environment setup.

Now, with Kubernetes Operator technology, you can run stateful database applications on Kubernetes. Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator extends Kubernetes to give you the power to easily create, configure and manage PostgreSQL clusters at scale. When combined with the Crunchy PostgreSQL Container Suite , the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator provides an open source software solution for PostgreSQL scaling, high-availability, disaster recovery, monitoring, and more. All of this capability comes with the repeatability and automation that comes from Operators on Kubernetes. Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator is open source and developed in close collaboration with users to support enterprise deployments of cloud agnostic PostgreSQL-as-a-Service capability. This release comes after extensive feedback from our customers and the community to ensure the scalability and security that sysadmins, DBAs, and developers have come to rely on.

IBM Cloud Pak Playbooks and GitOps IBM Cloud Pak Playbook cloud-native-toolkit/multi-tenancy-gitops \ud83c\udf1f Provides our opinionated point of view on how GitOps can be used to manage the infrastructure, services and application layers of K8s based systems. The GitOps concept originated from Weaveworks back in 2017 and the goal was to automate the operations of a Kubernetes (K8s) system using a model external to the system as the source of truth (History of GitOps). This repository provides our opinionated point of view on how GitOps can be used to manage the infrastructure, services and application layers of K8s based systems. It takes into account the various personas interacting with the system and accounts for separation of duties. The instructions and examples are focused around the Red Hat OpenShift platform and IBM Cloud Paks. The reference architecture for this GitOps workflow can be found here .

A resource adapter is a system library that provides connectivity to an enterprise information system (EIS). Similar to how a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver provides connectivity to a database management system, a resource adapter plugs into an application server such as Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP). It then connects the application server, enterprise information system, and the enterprise application.

Seed jobs Meetup event: From Freestyle jobs to Pipeline, with JobDSL Manually managing Jenkins jobs is painful. Jenkins Pipeline exists, but how do you get started and why should you bother in the first place? Journey with Nicolaj, as he talks about the pains of managing a manually configured job in Jenkins; converts a Freestyle Job to JobDSL, instantly; introduces mechanisms for adding the jobs to Jenkins, as code; and ultimately converts the job to a Jenkins Pipeline! Just like last time, in the talk \u201cConfiguration as Code of Jenkins (for Kubernetes),\u201d you\u2019ll see plenty of live demos and get to take home all the code and examples afterwards. Use it as the starting point for taking advantage of the Configuration as Code (CasC) that everyone is talking about, and hopefully it will save you a lot of headache in the future! Agenda: Manual Freestyle jobs, and why they hurt us Introduction to JobDSL and adding JobDSL-jobs to Jenkins From Freestyle Jobs to JobDSL, the beginning of our CasC adventure From JobDSL to Pipeline, all the fun of CasC; with even more resilience!

Formerly known as GVM the Groovy enVironment Manager , it was inspired by the very useful RVM and rbenv tools, used at large by the Ruby community. Using Jenkins Pipeline parallel stages to build Maven project with different JDKs Demo: A single Jenkinsfile, a Java Maven project, a single Dockerfile, multiple Java versions build and tested in parallel thanks to SDKMAN: Using SDKMAN! as a docker image for Jenkins Pipeline - a step by step guide \ud83c\udf1f Multiple Java versions in a single Jenkins Pipeline using Docker and SDKMAN \ud83c\udf1f In this video, I show you how you can use Jenkins Declarative Pipeline to create a build pipeline that compiles the Maven Java project using three different Java versions (8, 11, and 15.) You will learn how to use a matrix section of the Jenkins Pipeline to define parallel stages, as well as how to create a Docker image that provides both Java and Maven using the powerful SDKMAN command-line tool. After watching this video you should feel comfortable with setting up multiple parallel stages to build your Java project using different versions of the compiler. And what is most important - it does not require creating Dockerfiles for each Java version. I will show you how to build the pipeline using just a single Dockerfile that does the job.

This enables teams to focus on higher-level tasks, and outsources significant manual effort. containerjournal.com: Best of 2021 \u2013 Kubernetes Enables DevOps-as-a-Service (DaaS) IaC Infrastructure as Code IaC Infrastructure as Code Blogs devops.com devopscube.com devopszone.info devopsdigest.com Top 15 DevOps blogs to read and follow devopstips.net Xebia Labs and DevOps DevOps Glosary of Terms \ud83c\udf1f The Ultimate DevOps Tool Chest \ud83c\udf1f The Ultimate List of Open Source DevOps Tools Periodic Table of DevOps \ud83c\udf1f DevOps Tools These tools help you manage servers and deploy happier and more often with more confidence. medium: Technologies & Tools to Watch in 2021 \ud83c\udf1f DevOps Toolbox: Jenkins, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Vagrant, & SaltStack devopscube.com: Vagrant Tutorial For Beginners: Getting Started Guide devops.com: 11 Open Source DevOps Tools We Love For 2021 youtube: Thetips4you \ud83c\udf1f thenewstack.io: DevOps Is Fed by a Tools Culture Loop dzone.com: DevOps Toolchain for Beginners \ud83c\udf1f DevOps toolchain plays a crucial role in automating and orchestrating DevOps capabilities to deliver software at the desired speed and quality. gitkraken.com: DevOps Tools Report 2020 \ud83c\udf1f dzone: Top 12 DevOps Tools for Your DevOps Implementation Plan \ud83c\udf1f dzone: Most Popular DevOps Tools You Must Learn In 2019 dzone: 5 DevOps Tools You Should Know In 2019 From containers and automation to CI/CD, this list has five basic tools you need to get started with DevOps. guru99.com: 30 Best DevOps Tools & Technologies raygun.com: The 10 best DevOps tools for 2020 hackr.io: Top 10 DevOps Tools To Look For in 2020 medium: The 10 best DevOps tools for 2020 victorops.com: 20 Top DevOps Tools for 2020 techradar.com: techradar.com geekflare.com: devops-tools edureka.com: Top 10 DevOps Tools You Must Know In 2020 DevOps Tool Comparison: Docker Vs Kubernetes Vs Ansible cloudtweaks.com: DevOps - Secure and Scalable CI/CD Pipeline with AWS medium: DevOps tools Handbook \ud83c\udf1f reviewnprep.com: DevOps Tool Primer: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible ASDF \ud83c\udf1f Manage multiple runtime versions with a single CLI tool clarusway.com: Top 21 DevOps Tools Of 2021 (Comprehensive Guide) zigiwave.medium.com: Top 10 Tools your DevOps Teams Should Use in 2022 Data Driven DevOps Automation with Ketpn. Automating Service Level Indicators/Service Level Objectives based build validation with Keptn and Jenkins Keptn provides automated SLI/SLO-based quality gates Introduction to Data Driven DevOps Automation. Keptn is a CNCF sandbox project and aims to automate delivery and operational processes using a data-driven approach. Keptn\u2019s architecture solves a key problem with traditional automation tools where process and tool integrations are often hard coded or hard to maintain. Keptn uses an event-driven orchestrator with declarative process and tooling definitions that eliminate the need for any custom tool integration and make changing processes or tools a matter of changing a config file entry! At the core Keptn integrates with your observability platforms to automate SRE best practices such as SLO validation as part of your DevOps delivery and operations automation. Start automating your DevOps processes with Keptn to cover SLO-based Quality Gates, Performance & Chaos Test Automation, Event Driven Delivery as well as SRE-driven Auto-Remediation. tutorials.keptn.sh github.com/keptn/keptn Keptn Jenkins Shared Library integrates Jenkins and Keptn with just a couple of function calls. Jenkins Online Meetup Andreas Grabner from Dynatrace will talk about automating Service Level Indicators/Service Level Objectives based build validation with Keptn and Jenkins. In many organizations up to 80% of pipeline execution time is spent in manual build validation steps. How can we reduce that? One option is applying Google\u2019s SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices by automating SLI (Service Level Indicators) & SLO (Service Level Objectives) based build validation . This method has proven to detect problematic issues in production and also allows us to automatically approve or reject builds being pushed through our pipelines. In this session you learn the basics of picking good SLIs & SLOs and how to extract them from your monitoring tools. After this session you will be able to start implementing this integration yourself with Jenkins. To give you a jump start you will be introduced to the open source project Keptn which provides automated SLI/SLO-based quality gates . Then we\u2019ll talk about Keptn Jenkins Shared Library which integrates Jenkins and Keptn with just a couple of function calls. youtube: Level-Up your Jenkins-based Delivery with Keptn thenewstack.io: How Keptn Automatically Configures Prometheus Ecosystems github.com/keptn-sandbox/keptn-on-k3s: Tutorial: Keptn for Dynatrace Users in 5 Minutes \ud83c\udf1f - Tutorial on keptnProject with argoproj for canary deployments using Dynatrace for SLO-based rollout control youtube: Tutorial - Keptn in a box tutorials.keptn.sh \ud83c\udf1f tutorials.keptn.sh: Azure DevOps Pipelines with Keptn Quality Gates dynatrace-perfclinics.github.io: Why Devs Love Dynatrace \ud83c\udf1f Codelab explaining the benefits of automating SLO-based quality gates with keptnProject. keptn slides and videos Click to expand!

Keptn is a CNCF sandbox project and aims to automate delivery and operational processes using a data-driven approach. Keptn\u2019s architecture solves a key problem with traditional automation tools where process and tool integrations are often hard coded or hard to maintain. Keptn uses an event-driven orchestrator with declarative process and tooling definitions that eliminate the need for any custom tool integration and make changing processes or tools a matter of changing a config file entry! At the core Keptn integrates with your observability platforms to automate SRE best practices such as SLO validation as part of your DevOps delivery and operations automation. Start automating your DevOps processes with Keptn to cover SLO-based Quality Gates, Performance & Chaos Test Automation, Event Driven Delivery as well as SRE-driven Auto-Remediation. tutorials.keptn.sh github.com/keptn/keptn Keptn Jenkins Shared Library integrates Jenkins and Keptn with just a couple of function calls. Jenkins Online Meetup Andreas Grabner from Dynatrace will talk about automating Service Level Indicators/Service Level Objectives based build validation with Keptn and Jenkins. In many organizations up to 80% of pipeline execution time is spent in manual build validation steps. How can we reduce that? One option is applying Google\u2019s SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices by automating SLI (Service Level Indicators) & SLO (Service Level Objectives) based build validation . This method has proven to detect problematic issues in production and also allows us to automatically approve or reject builds being pushed through our pipelines. In this session you learn the basics of picking good SLIs & SLOs and how to extract them from your monitoring tools. After this session you will be able to start implementing this integration yourself with Jenkins. To give you a jump start you will be introduced to the open source project Keptn which provides automated SLI/SLO-based quality gates .

It is also recommended to consider frameworks that issue specific guidelines for easing the complexity of administering the security and compliance of a Kubernetes ecosystem. Such frameworks help organizations create flexible, iterative, and cost-effective approaches to keeping clusters and applications safe and compliant while ensuring optimum performance.

After the analysis, a report is generated that is used to implement a range of measures that guarantee the security and reliability of the code. Code audits can be carried out in parallel with penetration tests. They can test the exploitability of code vulnerabilities to better estimate the risk they pose. Ideally, code audits are performed throughout the application lifecycle. The faster a vulnerability is discovered, the easier it is to fix!

The study paints a troubling picture: Only 5% of survey respondents said most of their development teams use the same secrets management processes and tools. The incidents run the gamut, from secrets published in the clear in public cloud code repositories to insecure third-party code to vulnerabilities in the organization\u2019s own code or configurations. thorsten-hans.com: Encrypt your Kubernetes Secrets with Mozilla SOPS By default, Kubernetes Secrets (secrets) are stored with base64 encoding in YAML files. The lack of encryption for secrets often leads to the question of how to store secrets securely. Obviously, you don\u2019t want to put your sensitive configuration data into a git repository, because it is just encoded. echo | base64 -d. A typical solution is using services like Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault to persist sensitive data. Those services can be integrated with Kubernetes by using the Secrets Store CIS driver. However, relying on an additional service means that you have to manage and maintain that service in addition to Kubernetes. Additionally, depending on the service you use to store your sensitive data, some sensitive configuration must be stored somewhere to configure the CIS driver. As an alternative, you can use Mozilla SOPS (SOPS) to encrypt and decrypt your Kubernetes secret files. Secrets that are encrypted via SOPS can be stored in source control. Encrypted secrets will be decrypted locally just before they\u2019ll be deployed to Kubernetes. This article demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt Kubernetes secrets (YAML files) using SOPS in combination with Azure Key Vault, which allows you to store your secrets along with other Kubernetes manifests directly in git. developers.redhat.com: Protect secrets in Git with the clean/smudge filter kubeopsskills/cloud-secret-resolvers: Cloud Secret Resolvers (CSR) Cloud Secret Resolvers is a set of tools to help your applications (on Kubernetes) to retrieve any credentials from cloud managed vaults without the needed to write additional boilerplate code in your applications!.

The study paints a troubling picture: Only 5% of survey respondents said most of their development teams use the same secrets management processes and tools. The incidents run the gamut, from secrets published in the clear in public cloud code repositories to insecure third-party code to vulnerabilities in the organization\u2019s own code or configurations. thorsten-hans.com: Encrypt your Kubernetes Secrets with Mozilla SOPS By default, Kubernetes Secrets (secrets) are stored with base64 encoding in YAML files. The lack of encryption for secrets often leads to the question of how to store secrets securely. Obviously, you don\u2019t want to put your sensitive configuration data into a git repository, because it is just encoded. echo | base64 -d. A typical solution is using services like Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault to persist sensitive data. Those services can be integrated with Kubernetes by using the Secrets Store CIS driver. However, relying on an additional service means that you have to manage and maintain that service in addition to Kubernetes. Additionally, depending on the service you use to store your sensitive data, some sensitive configuration must be stored somewhere to configure the CIS driver. As an alternative, you can use Mozilla SOPS (SOPS) to encrypt and decrypt your Kubernetes secret files. Secrets that are encrypted via SOPS can be stored in source control. Encrypted secrets will be decrypted locally just before they\u2019ll be deployed to Kubernetes. This article demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt Kubernetes secrets (YAML files) using SOPS in combination with Azure Key Vault, which allows you to store your secrets along with other Kubernetes manifests directly in git. developers.redhat.com: Protect secrets in Git with the clean/smudge filter kubeopsskills/cloud-secret-resolvers: Cloud Secret Resolvers (CSR) Cloud Secret Resolvers is a set of tools to help your applications (on Kubernetes) to retrieve any credentials from cloud managed vaults without the needed to write additional boilerplate code in your applications!.","title":"Secrets Management"},{"location":"devsecops/#aws-secret-manager","text":"medium: AWS Secret Manager: Protect sensitive information and functionality \ud83c\udf1f Protect Your Secrets in ApplicationsSecrets are frequently used to protect sensitive information and functionality. blog.opstree.com: AWS Secret Manager aws/secrets-store-csi-driver-provider-aws: AWS Secrets Manager and Config Provider for Secret Store CSI Driver AWS offers two services to manage secrets and parameters conveniently in your code.

Docker\u2019s built-in docker image prune \u2013all \u2013filter until=\u2026 command serves a similar purpose. However, the built-in solution isn\u2019t ideal since it uses the image creation time, rather than the last usage time, to determine which images to remove. That means it can delete frequently used images, which may be expensive to rebuild. Docuum is ideal for use cases such as continuous integration (CI) workers, developer workstations, or any other environment in which Docker images accumulate on disk over time. Docuum works well with tools like Toast and Docker Compose. Docuum is used by Airbnb on its fleet of 1.5k+ CI workers. cloudsavvyit.com: 10 Tools That Complement Docker cybersecsi/RAUDI A repo to automatically generate and keep updated a series of Docker images through GitHub Actions. grosser/preoomkiller Softly kills your process with SIGTERM before it runs out of memory.

However, the built-in solution isn\u2019t ideal since it uses the image creation time, rather than the last usage time, to determine which images to remove. That means it can delete frequently used images, which may be expensive to rebuild. Docuum is ideal for use cases such as continuous integration (CI) workers, developer workstations, or any other environment in which Docker images accumulate on disk over time. Docuum works well with tools like Toast and Docker Compose.

Although branch creation has become very easy, it comes with a certain cost. Long living branches break the flow of the software delivery process, impacting throughput and stability. This session explores why teams are using feature branches, what problems are introduced by using them and what techniques exist to avoid them altogether. It explores exactly what\u2019s evil about feature branches, which is not necessarily the problems they introduce - but rather, the real reasons why teams are using them. youtube: Git Flow Is A Bad Idea - Dave Farley What is GitFlow and why is it a bad idea if you want to practice Continuous Delivery or Continuous Integration? GitFlow is a feature branching strategy that adds several extra layers of complexity. Git Flow is bad when we need fast feedback and a clear picture of the quality and \u2018releasability\u2019 of our work, so how do we adapt to get that faster feedback and a clearer picture?

Wikipedia: Software bot Tips Use bots to accomplish tasks like merging PR\u2019s that have been approved and automatically updating dependencies. Usage of one of these bots might allow us to trigger certain builds based off of specific GitHub tags, it would allow us to only selectively run certain test suites and increase the throughput of the build by only testing changes made in a branch / PR. Investigate options that are available and see if we can integrate them with CI. We should be able to configure this bot to automatically apply labels to PR\u2019s based off of what is changed in a PR. For instance, if a PR contains any documentation changes, the area/Documentation label can be applied.

Our group has a bot that creates merge requests for certain mechanical changes to our code base. We\u2019d like these MRs to get merged in automatically if/when the CI pipeline succeeds, but our projects require an approval from a member of our group. This means that right now a human has to manually click on \u201capprove\u201d and \u201cmerge\u201d for each bot-created MR. Apparently GitLab doesn\u2019t have a way to set different approval rules for some users, so I haven\u2019t found a way to make the bot\u2019s user immune to this requirement. My current idea is to have a separate process that approves each of the merge requests created by the bot. Is there an easy way to do this programmatically? That is, is there an API (or better yet, a command line tool) that, when given the name of the branch for a merge request, approves the merge request associated with that branch? I\u2019m also open to other ways of getting these changes in with minimal human intervention. I do want them to pass the CI pipeline, though (which is currently accomplished by having them use MRs) and the MRs also help in the rare cases where the pipeline fails, so we can debug what went wrong.

Our group has a bot that creates merge requests for certain mechanical changes to our code base. We\u2019d like these MRs to get merged in automatically if/when the CI pipeline succeeds, but our projects require an approval from a member of our group. This means that right now a human has to manually click on \u201capprove\u201d and \u201cmerge\u201d for each bot-created MR. Apparently GitLab doesn\u2019t have a way to set different approval rules for some users, so I haven\u2019t found a way to make the bot\u2019s user immune to this requirement. My current idea is to have a separate process that approves each of the merge requests created by the bot. Is there an easy way to do this programmatically? That is, is there an API (or better yet, a command line tool) that, when given the name of the branch for a merge request, approves the merge request associated with that branch? I\u2019m also open to other ways of getting these changes in with minimal human intervention. I do want them to pass the CI pipeline, though (which is currently accomplished by having them use MRs) and the MRs also help in the rare cases where the pipeline fails, so we can debug what went wrong.","title":"GitLab for git merges"},{"location":"git/#marge-gitlab-bot","text":"Marge-bot: A merge-bot for GitLab Example: gitlab.gnome.org/marge-merge-bot Example: Smarkets\u2019s Marge-bot for GitLab keeps master always green Example: GStreamer Merge Bot","title":"Marge GitLab bot"},{"location":"git/#jenkins-x-bots","text":"Jenkins-X UpdateBOT A simple bot for updating dependencies in source code and automatically generating Pull Requests in downstream projects.","title":"Jenkins-X bots"},{"location":"git/#plastic-scm-bot","text":"Plastic SCM blog.plasticscm.com: Add a mergebot to your repo!

If Bob goes down, it\u2019s all hands on deck. The CEO can\u2019t get his email and it\u2019s the end of the world. In the new way, servers are numbered, like cattle in a herd. For example, www001 to www100. When one server goes down, it\u2019s taken out back, shot, and replaced on the line. Pets : Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique systems that can never be down. Typically they are manually built, managed, and \u201chand fed\u201d. Examples include mainframes, solitary servers, HA loadbalancers/firewalls (active/active or active/passive), database systems designed as master/slave (active/passive), and so on. Cattle : Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated tools, and are designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable. Typically, during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits attributes of \u201crouting around failures\u201d by restarting failed servers or replicating data through strategies like triple replication or erasure coding. Examples include web server arrays, multi-master datastores such as Cassandra clusters, multiple racks of gear put together in clusters, and just about anything that is load-balanced and multi-master. traefik.io: Pets vs. Cattle: The Future of Kubernetes in 2022 Technical Debt medium: Technical debt 101 A primer about technical debt, legacy code, big rewrites and ancient wisdom for non technical managers infoq.com: Managing Technical Debt in a Microservice Architecture Twelve-Factor Apps in Kubernetes acloudguru.com: Twelve-Factor Apps in Kubernetes opensource.com: An open source developer\u2019s guide to 12-Factor App methodology How 12 basic principles can help teams build highly scalable apps quickly and efficiently.

If Bob goes down, it\u2019s all hands on deck. The CEO can\u2019t get his email and it\u2019s the end of the world. In the new way, servers are numbered, like cattle in a herd. For example, www001 to www100. When one server goes down, it\u2019s taken out back, shot, and replaced on the line. Pets : Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique systems that can never be down. Typically they are manually built, managed, and \u201chand fed\u201d. Examples include mainframes, solitary servers, HA loadbalancers/firewalls (active/active or active/passive), database systems designed as master/slave (active/passive), and so on. Cattle : Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated tools, and are designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable. Typically, during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits attributes of \u201crouting around failures\u201d by restarting failed servers or replicating data through strategies like triple replication or erasure coding. Examples include web server arrays, multi-master datastores such as Cassandra clusters, multiple racks of gear put together in clusters, and just about anything that is load-balanced and multi-master. traefik.io: Pets vs. Cattle: The Future of Kubernetes in 2022","title":"Pets vs Cattle Analogy"},{"location":"introduction/#technical-debt","text":"medium: Technical debt 101 A primer about technical debt, legacy code, big rewrites and ancient wisdom for non technical managers infoq.com: Managing Technical Debt in a Microservice Architecture","title":"Technical Debt"},{"location":"introduction/#twelve-factor-apps-in-kubernetes","text":"acloudguru.com: Twelve-Factor Apps in Kubernetes opensource.com: An open source developer\u2019s guide to 12-Factor App methodology How 12 basic principles can help teams build highly scalable apps quickly and efficiently.","title":"Twelve-Factor Apps in Kubernetes"},{"location":"introduction/#architecture-decision-records","text":"redhat.com: Why you should be using architecture decision records to document your project Documenting architectural decisions helps a project succeed by helping current and future contributors understand the reasons for doing things a certain way.","title":"Architecture Decision Records"},{"location":"introduction/#self-service-developer-platform","text":"weave.works: What is a self-service developer platform and why does it matter?","title":"Self service developer platform"},{"location":"introduction/#disaster-recovery","text":"thenewstack.io: Disaster Recovery Is Different for the Cloud","title":"Disaster Recovery"},{"location":"introduction/#saas","text":"blog.scaleway.com: SaaS Solutions - What is the difference between a multi-instance and a multi-tenant architecture","title":"SaaS"},{"location":"introduction/#multi-cloud","text":"acloudguru.com: Sharing data in the cloud: 4 patterns you should know architectelevator.com: Multi Cloud Architecture: Decisions and Options Multi cloud means different things to different people.

Como bien dices es un espacio contiguo al heap, pero tambi\u00e9n se limpia cada vez que la tenured/old generation procede a un GC. No es una generaci\u00f3n separada del mismo modo que es la young generation, y no hay un mecanismo espec\u00edfico para un GC separado de PermGen. La tenured/old generation y la permanent generation proceden a un GC cuando una de las dos se llena. De todos modos no me queda claro si incorporaron PermGen dentro del heap en Java 7, aunque poco importa ya con los cambios en Java 8. Mejor empiezo por introducir qu\u00e9 implementaci\u00f3n de JVM es Java 8 de Oracle. Existen numerosas implementaciones de JVM y cada una utiliza diferentes soluciones para la gesti\u00f3n de memoria. Dos de las soluciones m\u00e1s conocidas y populares de JVM han sido HotSpot de Sun (habitual en Tomcat) y JRockit de BEA (Weblogic). Ambas compa\u00f1ias fueron compradas por Oracle y Java 8 viene a ser la integraci\u00f3n definitiva de ambas soluciones. Hist\u00f3ricamente se consideraba que HotSpot es el JVM con mejor rendimiento de las dos, si bien JRockit es valorada como la m\u00e1s escalable. Originalmente en HotSpot no hab\u00eda generaci\u00f3n permanente. Objetos y clases de JVM se almacenaban juntas. Las clases de \u00e9sta JVM eran est\u00e1ticas y pr\u00e1cticamente no se utilizaban \u2018Class Loaders\u2019 (Load y Unload/Collection de Clases). PermGen surgi\u00f3 como una mejora de rendimiento. Por defecto los datos en la generaci\u00f3n permanente no se eliminan nunca (son datos de JVM y no de aplicaci\u00f3n, pudiendo variar seg\u00fan la p\u00f3l\u00edtica de garbage collection). Esto pod\u00eda llenar la generaci\u00f3n permanente generando un OutOfMemoryErrors si se produc\u00eda un elevado n\u00famero de classloading. En muchos casos un problema con una generaci\u00f3n permanente implica reiniciar regularmente la JVM y la aplicaci\u00f3n Java. Actualmente las clases de JVM son din\u00e1micas y el espacio requerido para metadatos puede cambiar f\u00e1cilmente. A diferencia de HotSpot VM, JRockit carece de generaci\u00f3n permanente y en cambio almacena los metadatos \u2018off the heap\u2019 en memoria nativa. Estos buffers de c\u00f3digo son liberados constantemente cuando sus ClassLoaders no se utilizan. El problema de OutOfMemory en JRockit no es diferente a HotSpot, excepto por el hecho de ser memoria nativa en lugar de memoria heap. Hay dos diferencias significativas. Primero, en JRockit la limpieza de metadatos est\u00e1 habilitada siempre por defecto y segundo, no hay tama\u00f1o l\u00edmite fijo para el espacio de metadatos. Uno de los principales problemas con HotSpot es su dificultad para seleccionar un tama\u00f1o adecuado para la generaci\u00f3n permanente. \u00bf128MB, 256MB? Es muy dif\u00edcil acertar para cada aplicaci\u00f3n. JRockit es din\u00e1mico en la gesti\u00f3n de memoria reservada para metadatos y sin l\u00edmites de tama\u00f1o (a excepci\u00f3n de la memoria del sistema). JRockit es tambi\u00e9n el \u00fanico JVM con soporte de heaps no contiguos (uso de memoria por encima y por debajo del alojamiento del kernel y otras librer\u00edas), importante en el caso de Windows donde su kernel a menudo se ubica en mitad del espacio de direcciones. Java 8 (HotRockit?) incorpora todas las herramientas de monitorizaci\u00f3n de HotSpot (Java VisualVM, jstat, jmap) y JRockit (Java Mission Control, Java Flight Recorder). Muy interesante. Un inconveniente de Java 8 es la fragmentaci\u00f3n de la memoria nativa para metadatos, pero probablemente incluya compactaci\u00f3n en un futuro pr\u00f3ximo. En el 2016 saldr\u00e1 Java 9 con la funcionalidad de auto-tuning y soporte de tama\u00f1os Heap multi-gigas. En cualquier caso hay una tendencia al Heap-Offloading. El consumo de memoria en Java tiene un coste y las pausas/latencias causadas por los Full GC son proporcionales al tama\u00f1o del heap. Estas pausas son notables en tama\u00f1os de heap > 1Gb, con un considerable impacto en aplicaciones de tiempo real donde un proceso que no responde r\u00e1pido puede ser descartado del cluster. A\u00fan as\u00ed, los servidores actuales hacen uso de frameworks muy pesados y f\u00e1cilmente requieren heaps > 4Gb. Una soluci\u00f3n a este problema es alojar fuera del heap los objetos poco utilizados mediante t\u00e9cnicas de serializaci\u00f3n/deserializaci\u00f3n (cach\u00e9). El heap de memoria se mantiene peque\u00f1o y el Full GC se completa en milisegundos. Ejemplos: cach\u00e9 de sesi\u00f3n de usuarios, donde un fichero mapeado en memoria almacena gigabytes de sesiones de usuarios inactivos. Una vez que el usuario hace log-in, la aplicaci\u00f3n dispone de todos sus datos sin ser necesaria una consulta a la BBDD. cach\u00e9 de resultados computacionales como queries, p\u00e1ginas html, etc (donde el coste computacional es mayor a la deserializaci\u00f3n) Slides Click to expand!

We\u2019ll then discuss why we decided to move from Jenkins to Tekton, how we plan to scale it beyond a few teams, and what kind of challenges we have faced and arecurrently facing. We started with Jenkins shared libs, and wrote common implementation for one group of engineering teams. This worked very well because not only were we able to consolidate and refactor all pipelines at once leading to several optimizations, it also made it easy to understand the CI implementation for all similar services and if we were to add common features and bug fixes it was really easy to push it through a common implementation. There were benefits of doing this, but what was not desirable is that it took us a lot of effort to build these shared libs and despite our efforts to keep them simple, they ended up looking very complicated. Standard pipeline specs had departed from being declarative in nature and there was a lot of imperative Groovy logic mixed with Pipeline DSL. itnext.io: Tekton Pipelines Kickstarter.

It is important to understand the differences between these plugins and Job DSL for managing Jenkins configuration efficiently. In consequence 3 DSL s are available to configure jenkins as code: DSL 1: Job DSL DSL 2: Jenkins (Declarative) Pipeline DSL 3: Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC) Tip: Don\u2019t stay with manually configured freestyle jobs.

Jenkins Pipeline. Pipeline as Code with Jenkins Pipeline as Code with Jenkins \ud83c\udf1f Why Pipeline? Jenkins is, fundamentally, an automation engine which supports a number of automation patterns. Pipeline adds a powerful set of automation tools onto Jenkins, supporting use cases that span from simple continuous integration to comprehensive CD pipelines. By modeling a series of related tasks, users can take advantage of the many features of Pipeline: Code : Pipelines are implemented in code and typically checked into source control, giving teams the ability to edit, review, and iterate upon their delivery pipeline. Durable : Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the Jenkins master. Pausable : Pipelines can optionally stop and wait for human input or approval before continuing the Pipeline run. Versatile : Pipelines support complex real-world CD requirements, including the ability to fork/join, loop, and perform work in parallel. Extensible : The Pipeline plugin supports custom extensions to its DSL and multiple options for integration with other plugins. jenkins.io - doc/book/pipeline \ud83c\udf1f jenkins.io - Jenkinsfile \ud83c\udf1f With version 2 of the Jenkins Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) server, a new job definition file has been introduced, called Jenkinsfile . The initial Jenkinsfile format was based on Groovy. As groovy knowledge is not that widespread, a new and more straight forward was published in spring 2017. This format is called Declarative Pipeline . This visual studio code extension is aimed at making the manipulation of this file type easier.

First, a history lesson. Scripted syntax was released around December of 2014. In February 2017, Declarative syntax was introduced. Until Declarative was released, we had no choice but to use Scripted syntax. However, since that time, many new features, such as matrix, have only been made available for Declarative. Use shared libraries. Do you remember the days of when you used inline JavaScript in your web pages? When you introduce a \u201cscript\u201d tag into a Declarative pipeline, that\u2019s a warning sign that you are starting to head down the same path. When you decide that the \u201cscript\u201d tag is the only way to go, instead of using the \u201cscript\u201d tag, you should instead create a custom step in a shared library and use that step within your Declarative pipeline. Don\u2019t use shared libraries (the wrong way). Wait, what? You just told me to use shared libraries and now you\u2019re telling me not to use shared libraries. What gives? Many people will treat shared libraries like a programming project. Here\u2019s the thing to keep in mind. Scripted and Declarative syntax are meant to only do CI tasks and not to be a general purpose programming language. Many Jenkins controller performance issues can be traced back to the misuse of scripted syntax and shared libraries written in a way where all the work is being done within the Jenkins controller itself instead of on the agents. Only use Scripted syntax when it doesn\u2019t make sense to use Declarative plus a shared library. cuelogic.com: Decoding Pipeline as Code (With Jenkins) \ud83c\udf1f Pipeline as code technique rests on the paradigm that delivery pipeline configuration which builds, tests, deploys applications, and software infrastructure must be treated as code. mishra-praveen.medium.com: Comprehensive Guide To Jenkins Declarative Pipeline [With Examples] How to share a Declarative Pipeline. Examples of Declarative Pipelines in Shared Libraries: mtijhof.wordpress.com: Jenkins: Running a declarative pipeline from your Shared Library \ud83c\udf1f Starting with Declarative 1.2, released in late September, 2017, you can define Declarative Pipelines in your shared libraries as well \ud83c\udf1f Only entire pipelines can be defined in shared libraries as of this time. This can only be done in vars/*.groovy, and only in a call method. Only one Declarative Pipeline can be executed in a single build, and if you attempt to execute a second one, your build will fail as a result. Declarative Pipeline - Jenkins shared library \ud83c\udf1f stackoverflow.com: Can I have an entire declarative pipeline defined and parameterized in a shared library? jenkins.io: Share a standard Pipeline across multiple projects with Shared Libraries \ud83c\udf1f jenkins.io: Parallel stages with Declarative Pipeline 1.2 \ud83c\udf1f Jenkins Pipeline Syntax. Scripted Syntax (Groovy DSL syntax) VS Declarative Syntax Jenkins Pipeline Syntax: Scripted Syntax (Groovy DSL syntax) & Declarative Syntax \ud83c\udf1f : Version 2.5 of the \u201cPipeline plugin\u201d released in 2016/05/16 introduces support for Declarative Pipeline syntax . Declarative Pipeline is a relatively recent addition to Jenkins Pipeline which presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems. Building Declarative Pipelines with OpenShift DSL Plugin : Jenkinsfiles have only become an integral part of Jenkins since version 2 but they have quickly become the de-facto standard for building continuous delivery pipelines with Jenkins. Jenkinsfile allows defining pipelines as code using a Groovy DSL syntax and checking it into source version control which allows you to track, review, audit, and manage the lifecycle of changes to the continuous delivery pipelines the same way that you manage the source code of your application. Although the Groovy DSL syntax which is referred to as the scripted syntax is the more well-known and established syntax for building Jenkins pipelines and was the default when Jenkins 2 was released , support for a newer declarative syntax is also added since Jenkins 2.5 in order to offer a simplified way for controlling all aspects of the pipeline. Although the scripted and declarative syntax provides two ways to define your pipeline, they both translate to the same execution blocks in Jenkins and achieve the same result. The declarative syntax in its simplest form is composed of an agent which defines the Jenkins slave to be used for executing the pipeline and a number of stages and each stage with a number of steps to be performed. Extending with Shared Libraries Shared-libraries with scripted pipeline syntax are not recommended since more coding involves more maintenance issues.

Are you tired of copying and pasting Jenkinsfiles and tweaking them to fit each team\u2019s specific needs? This session will feature a live demonstration of getting up and running with the Jenkins Templating Engine (JTE). Attendees will learn how to stop creating bespoke pipelines on a per-application basis and, instead, create tool-agnostic pipeline templates that multiple teams can inherit - regardless of tech stack. For DevSecOps engineers, this means less copying and pasting and more time spent focusing on the fun parts of the job. For managers or executives worried about compliance and standardization, this approach will ensure security is embedded in every step of the software development lifecycle for every application development team they oversee. Through JTE, businesses can find order in the chaos of managing DevSecOps pipelines at scale. Enable organizational governance, optimize pipeline code reuse and simplify pipeline management for the whole team.

Jenkins Plugin Parent POM 4.0 Plugin Development Plugin Development: Dependency Management Parent POM for Jenkins Plugins. Plugin POM 4.0 This new parent POM is decoupled from the core Jenkins project, both from the Maven and repository perspectives. 4.0 changelog Maven is widely used for Jenkins plugin development, more than 90% of plugins use it. In order to simplify plugin development, the Jenkins project offers a standard Parent POM which defines the recommended build, verification and release flow. Such parent POM helps us to ensure quality of the Jenkins plugins. In April 2020 we released a new major release of the parent POM which includes a number of important and sometimes incompatible changes: Jenkins core Bill of materials, full migration to SpotBugs, etc. In this presentation James Nord will talk about the changes introduced in Plugin POM 4.0. What do plugin developers and users get by upgrading? How to upgrade? What obstacles to expect, and how to resolve them?

External Fingerprint Storage Phase-1 Updates Externalizing fingerprint storage for Jenkins is a Google Summer of Code 2020 project. Fingerprinting is a way to track which version of a file is being used by a job/build, making dependency tracking easy. The fingerprint engine of Jenkins can track usages of artifacts, credentials, files, images, etc. within the system. Currently, it does this by maintaining a local XML-based database. Advantages of using external storage drivers: Remove dependence on Jenkins master disk storage Support for configure pay-as-you-use cloud storages Easy Backup Management Better Reliability and Availability Fingerprints can be tracked across Jenkins instances Redis Fingerprint Storage Plugin Jenkins and Spring Boot jaxenter.com - CI/CD for Spring Boot Microservices piotrminkowski.wordpress.com: Kotlin microservice with spring boot Docker in Docker.

The new offering strengthens CloudBees\u2019 leadership in the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) space by extending users\u2019 ability to leverage feature flag technology in both on-premise and cloud environments. CloudBees Feature Flags is from the company and application formerly known as Rollout, acquired last year by CloudBees . Feature flags have emerged as popular tools for deploying new features with the added advantage of enabling risk-free experimentation and fast results. As organizations enhance applications with rich new capabilities, many use feature flags to preview features for select audiences, with the ability to pull them back quickly if the functionality is not successful. In a recent survey , 97% of respondents say that it is important for their organization to implement new application features quickly, yet 65% say it is difficult for their organization to do so safely. CloudBees Feature Flags enables developers to easily release new features with confidence, reduce risk in doing so and manage large numbers of feature flags at scale. \u201cVery soon, all features will be released behind a feature flag. It\u2019s a natural evolution in continuous delivery. CloudBees has led the way in feature flag technology, making it a core part of our overall offering,\u201d said Sacha Labourey, CEO and co-founder, CloudBees. \u201cWith this release, we are providing the same functionality for on-premise environments that previously had only been available as a cloud-based service. We are committed to the ongoing integration, automation and governance of feature flags within the software delivery lifecycle and giving users choice in selecting the best environment for their project \u2013 on-premise or cloud.\u201d CloudBees Feature Flags integrates with the company\u2019s deep CI/CD capabilities, giving organizations the most comprehensive feature management capabilities in the software development life cycle (SDLC). The ability to use feature flagging in an on-premise environment also opens up new avenues for usage in industries, such as government, finance, pharmaceuticals, utilities and healthcare, where there can be a mix of on-premise and cloud environments. \u201cWe recognize that many companies are realizing the benefits of feature flags,\u201d said Moritz Plassnig, senior vice president and general manager, Software Delivery Management and Software Delivery Automation Cloud at CloudBees. \u201cBy flagging features, they no longer have to sacrifice innovation to lower risk. We felt that it was critical to offer this technology to any company working in on-premise or hybrid environments.\u201d CloudBees Accelerator CloudBees Accelerator Shorten Build and Test Times How to Speed Up Software Development with Build and Test Acceleration Tools Jenkins Scripts Two very helpful collections of utility groovy scripts: jenkinsci/jenkins-scripts \ud83c\udf1f samrocketman/jenkins-script-console-scripts \ud83c\udf1f A repository of one-off script console scripts for Jenkins.

SCM Filter Jervis YAML Plugin This plugin is intended for Jenkins infrastructure relying on jervis to deliver software in a self-service manner. This plugin can also be used for Travis CI YAML. Jenkins X (Serverless) Jenkins X is a specialized Jenkins for Kubernetes: This is how it works from a bird eye the CI/CD: a developer creates a branch, then Jenkins X creates a ephemeral namespace with that branch. The developer tests it and once it is ok, a PR is created, then, the branch is deployed in staging. When I merge it, it goes to QA, and with a manual command \u201cjx promote\u201d it goes to production. Jenkins X deletes automatically after N hours the branch namespace. Why Do We Need Jenkins X To Be Serverless? Initially, Jenkins X had a stripped-down version of Jenkins but, since the release 2, not a single line of the traditional Jenkins is left in Jenkins X. Now it is fully serverless thanks to Tekton and a lot of custom code written from scratch to support the need for a modern Kubernetes-based solution. jenkins-x.io itnext.io/tagged/jenkins-x itnext.io: Jenkins X \u2014 Managing Jenkins Video Tutorials: Youtube: Jenkins X: Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes with James Strachan Youtube: Kubernetes Package Management with Helm and CI/CD with Jenkins X - Webinar by Neependra Khare go.digitalocean.com/cicd-on-k8s blog.csanchez.org: Serverless Jenkins Pipelines with Google Cloud Run Jobs execute in Cloud Run (fast, scalable, pay per use compute) Ships as a container (extensible) Posts cat pics (amazing) Jenkins and SAP blogs.sap.com: Continuous quality using plugins and Jenkins (ABAP & UI5) blogs.sap.com: CI/CD Tools for SAP Cloud Platform ABAP Environment sap.github.io/jenkins-library Jenkins shared library for Continuous Delivery pipelines. - Project Piper Repository The Project \u201cPiper\u201d offers default pipelines to easily implement CI/CD processes integrating SAP systems.

Jenkins is, fundamentally, an automation engine which supports a number of automation patterns. Pipeline adds a powerful set of automation tools onto Jenkins, supporting use cases that span from simple continuous integration to comprehensive CD pipelines. By modeling a series of related tasks, users can take advantage of the many features of Pipeline: Code : Pipelines are implemented in code and typically checked into source control, giving teams the ability to edit, review, and iterate upon their delivery pipeline. Durable : Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the Jenkins master. Pausable : Pipelines can optionally stop and wait for human input or approval before continuing the Pipeline run. Versatile : Pipelines support complex real-world CD requirements, including the ability to fork/join, loop, and perform work in parallel. Extensible : The Pipeline plugin supports custom extensions to its DSL and multiple options for integration with other plugins. jenkins.io - doc/book/pipeline \ud83c\udf1f jenkins.io - Jenkinsfile \ud83c\udf1f With version 2 of the Jenkins Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) server, a new job definition file has been introduced, called Jenkinsfile . The initial Jenkinsfile format was based on Groovy. As groovy knowledge is not that widespread, a new and more straight forward was published in spring 2017. This format is called Declarative Pipeline . This visual studio code extension is aimed at making the manipulation of this file type easier.

First, a history lesson. Scripted syntax was released around December of 2014. In February 2017, Declarative syntax was introduced. Until Declarative was released, we had no choice but to use Scripted syntax. However, since that time, many new features, such as matrix, have only been made available for Declarative. Use shared libraries. Do you remember the days of when you used inline JavaScript in your web pages? When you introduce a \u201cscript\u201d tag into a Declarative pipeline, that\u2019s a warning sign that you are starting to head down the same path. When you decide that the \u201cscript\u201d tag is the only way to go, instead of using the \u201cscript\u201d tag, you should instead create a custom step in a shared library and use that step within your Declarative pipeline. Don\u2019t use shared libraries (the wrong way). Wait, what? You just told me to use shared libraries and now you\u2019re telling me not to use shared libraries. What gives? Many people will treat shared libraries like a programming project. Here\u2019s the thing to keep in mind. Scripted and Declarative syntax are meant to only do CI tasks and not to be a general purpose programming language. Many Jenkins controller performance issues can be traced back to the misuse of scripted syntax and shared libraries written in a way where all the work is being done within the Jenkins controller itself instead of on the agents. Only use Scripted syntax when it doesn\u2019t make sense to use Declarative plus a shared library. cuelogic.com: Decoding Pipeline as Code (With Jenkins) \ud83c\udf1f Pipeline as code technique rests on the paradigm that delivery pipeline configuration which builds, tests, deploys applications, and software infrastructure must be treated as code. mishra-praveen.medium.com: Comprehensive Guide To Jenkins Declarative Pipeline [With Examples]","title":"DSL 2.

Declarative Pipeline is a relatively recent addition to Jenkins Pipeline which presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems. Building Declarative Pipelines with OpenShift DSL Plugin : Jenkinsfiles have only become an integral part of Jenkins since version 2 but they have quickly become the de-facto standard for building continuous delivery pipelines with Jenkins. Jenkinsfile allows defining pipelines as code using a Groovy DSL syntax and checking it into source version control which allows you to track, review, audit, and manage the lifecycle of changes to the continuous delivery pipelines the same way that you manage the source code of your application. Although the Groovy DSL syntax which is referred to as the scripted syntax is the more well-known and established syntax for building Jenkins pipelines and was the default when Jenkins 2 was released , support for a newer declarative syntax is also added since Jenkins 2.5 in order to offer a simplified way for controlling all aspects of the pipeline. Although the scripted and declarative syntax provides two ways to define your pipeline, they both translate to the same execution blocks in Jenkins and achieve the same result. The declarative syntax in its simplest form is composed of an agent which defines the Jenkins slave to be used for executing the pipeline and a number of stages and each stage with a number of steps to be performed.","title":"Jenkins Pipeline Syntax.

The new offering strengthens CloudBees\u2019 leadership in the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) space by extending users\u2019 ability to leverage feature flag technology in both on-premise and cloud environments. CloudBees Feature Flags is from the company and application formerly known as Rollout, acquired last year by CloudBees . Feature flags have emerged as popular tools for deploying new features with the added advantage of enabling risk-free experimentation and fast results. As organizations enhance applications with rich new capabilities, many use feature flags to preview features for select audiences, with the ability to pull them back quickly if the functionality is not successful. In a recent survey , 97% of respondents say that it is important for their organization to implement new application features quickly, yet 65% say it is difficult for their organization to do so safely. CloudBees Feature Flags enables developers to easily release new features with confidence, reduce risk in doing so and manage large numbers of feature flags at scale. \u201cVery soon, all features will be released behind a feature flag. It\u2019s a natural evolution in continuous delivery. CloudBees has led the way in feature flag technology, making it a core part of our overall offering,\u201d said Sacha Labourey, CEO and co-founder, CloudBees. \u201cWith this release, we are providing the same functionality for on-premise environments that previously had only been available as a cloud-based service. We are committed to the ongoing integration, automation and governance of feature flags within the software delivery lifecycle and giving users choice in selecting the best environment for their project \u2013 on-premise or cloud.\u201d CloudBees Feature Flags integrates with the company\u2019s deep CI/CD capabilities, giving organizations the most comprehensive feature management capabilities in the software development life cycle (SDLC). The ability to use feature flagging in an on-premise environment also opens up new avenues for usage in industries, such as government, finance, pharmaceuticals, utilities and healthcare, where there can be a mix of on-premise and cloud environments. \u201cWe recognize that many companies are realizing the benefits of feature flags,\u201d said Moritz Plassnig, senior vice president and general manager, Software Delivery Management and Software Delivery Automation Cloud at CloudBees. \u201cBy flagging features, they no longer have to sacrifice innovation to lower risk. We felt that it was critical to offer this technology to any company working in on-premise or hybrid environments.\u201d","title":"Feature Flags in CloudBees Enterprise On-Premise"},{"location":"jenkins/#cloudbees-accelerator","text":"CloudBees Accelerator Shorten Build and Test Times How to Speed Up Software Development with Build and Test Acceleration Tools","title":"CloudBees Accelerator"},{"location":"jenkins/#jenkins-scripts","text":"Two very helpful collections of utility groovy scripts: jenkinsci/jenkins-scripts \ud83c\udf1f samrocketman/jenkins-script-console-scripts \ud83c\udf1f A repository of one-off script console scripts for Jenkins.","title":"Jenkins Scripts"},{"location":"jenkins/#backup-for-jenkins-on-kubernetes","text":"igorzhivilo.com: Simple Backup for Jenkins on Kubernetes - ref2: medium","title":"Backup for Jenkins on Kubernetes"},{"location":"jenkins/#jervis-jenkins-as-a-service","text":"Jervis is Sam Gleske \u2018s vision of a good way to roll out Jenkins as a service in very large organizations.

The old (and somewhat broken) flags -XX:{Min|Max}RAMFraction are now deprecated. There is a new flag -XX:MaxRAMPercentage, that takes a value between 0.0 and 100.0 and defaults to 25.0. So if there is a 1 GB memory limit, the JVM heap is limited to ~250 MB by default. While this can certainly be improved \u2014 depending on the RAM size and workload \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty good default compared to the old behaviour. https://medium.com/adorsys/usecontainersupport-to-the-rescue-e77d6cfea712 -XX:+UseContainerSupport Enabled by default Java 8u191+ required (enabled by default in Linux) https://medium.com/adorsys/jvm-memory-settings-in-a-container-environment-64b0840e1d9e https://medium.com/adorsys/usecontainersupport-to-the-rescue-e77d6cfea712 Please note that setting -Xmx and -Xms disables the automatic heap sizing. # check if +UseContainerSupport is enabled $ java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version -XshowSettings:vm Yes This is a priceless feature to display all the settings of the JVM, together with -XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags it can show a world of hidden stuff. http://www.javamonamour.org/2018/11/java-showsettings.html -XX:MaxRAMFraction No (deprecated) Requires JDK 8u131+ -XX:MaxRAMFraction deprecated since Java 8u191+ (use -XX:MaxRAMPercentage instead) https://dzone.com/articles/running-a-jvm-in-a-container-without-getting-kille https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/03/14/java-inside-docker/ https://merikan.com/2019/04/jvm-in-a-container/ -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap No (deprecated) JDK 8u131+ required Deprecated in Java10 & Java8u191+ https://dzone.com/articles/running-a-jvm-in-a-container-without-getting-kille https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/03/14/java-inside-docker/ https://merikan.com/2019/04/jvm-in-a-container/ Java memory management and configuration is still complex. Although the JVM can read cgroup memory limits and adapt memory usage accordingly since Java 9/8u131, it\u2019s not a golden bullet. You need to know what -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap does and you need to fine tune some parameters for every deployment. Otherwise you risk wasting resources and money or getting your containers killed at the worst time possible. -XX:MaxRAMFraction=1 is especially dangerous.

The framework takes care of the tedious details around execution on Kubernetes and presents a homogeneous operational experience across applications at scale. blog.kasten.io: Move Fast and Test in Kubernetes without Breaking Things with kanister and CI/CD \ud83c\udf1f When using data mobility to improve your CI/CD pipeline, it\u2019s important to consider the data at different layers in your application stack. In many instances, you must perform operations on multiple layers of your application at once, as well as interact with Kubernetes itself. Kasten by Veeam developed Kanister to address these data mobility challenges and enable organizations to test safely with real data. Kanister, an open source project, provides a Kubernetes-native framework for application-level data management that supports complex data management workflows. Domain experts can capture application-specific data management tasks in blueprints, which can be easily shared and extended, eliminating many of the tedious details around execution on Kubernetes. Kanister is easy to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline, because it uses Kubernetes API extensions called custom resources. You can easily extend Kanister to work with custom applications as well as several common cloud native databases, simplifying and streamlining testing operations while reducing risk. thenewstack.io: DevSecOps Teams Need Application-Consistent Backups for Kubernetes Workloads percona.com: Using Volume Snapshot/Clone in Kubernetes (GKE & Percona Kubernetes Operator for XtraDB Cluster) kasten.io: Kubernetes Application Mobility Reliable and Powerful Migration of Complete Applications Across Kubernetes Clusters. longhorn issue: Move replica to a different server aithority.com: Bacula Systems Announces World\u2019s First Enterprise-Class Backup and Recovery Solution for Red Hat OpenShift cloudify.co: Migrating Pods With Containerized Applications Between Nodes In The Same Kubernetes Cluster Using Cloudify \ud83c\udf1f thenewstack.io: Red Hat Brings Backup, Snapshots to OpenShift Container Storage thenewstack.io: 5 Best Practices to Back up Kubernetes Bacula Enterprise for OpenShift and Kubernetes \ud83c\udf1f dani-izquierdo95.medium.com: Batch processing using Cron Jobs.

KANISTER allows domain experts to capture application specific data management tasks in blueprints which can be easily shared and extended. The framework takes care of the tedious details around execution on Kubernetes and presents a homogeneous operational experience across applications at scale. blog.kasten.io: Move Fast and Test in Kubernetes without Breaking Things with kanister and CI/CD \ud83c\udf1f When using data mobility to improve your CI/CD pipeline, it\u2019s important to consider the data at different layers in your application stack. In many instances, you must perform operations on multiple layers of your application at once, as well as interact with Kubernetes itself. Kasten by Veeam developed Kanister to address these data mobility challenges and enable organizations to test safely with real data. Kanister, an open source project, provides a Kubernetes-native framework for application-level data management that supports complex data management workflows. Domain experts can capture application-specific data management tasks in blueprints, which can be easily shared and extended, eliminating many of the tedious details around execution on Kubernetes. Kanister is easy to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline, because it uses Kubernetes API extensions called custom resources. You can easily extend Kanister to work with custom applications as well as several common cloud native databases, simplifying and streamlining testing operations while reducing risk. thenewstack.io: DevSecOps Teams Need Application-Consistent Backups for Kubernetes Workloads percona.com: Using Volume Snapshot/Clone in Kubernetes (GKE & Percona Kubernetes Operator for XtraDB Cluster) kasten.io: Kubernetes Application Mobility Reliable and Powerful Migration of Complete Applications Across Kubernetes Clusters. longhorn issue: Move replica to a different server aithority.com: Bacula Systems Announces World\u2019s First Enterprise-Class Backup and Recovery Solution for Red Hat OpenShift cloudify.co: Migrating Pods With Containerized Applications Between Nodes In The Same Kubernetes Cluster Using Cloudify \ud83c\udf1f thenewstack.io: Red Hat Brings Backup, Snapshots to OpenShift Container Storage thenewstack.io: 5 Best Practices to Back up Kubernetes Bacula Enterprise for OpenShift and Kubernetes \ud83c\udf1f dani-izquierdo95.medium.com: Batch processing using Cron Jobs.

Not Minikube, neither Skaffold, but Tilt to the rescue. Minikube: Initially, they found Minikube as the first solution to manipulate K8s and test everything in our local environment. To manually deploy a service in Minikube they had to build the image in docker every time they made a change. If you are only managing one service this would be easy to handle, but if we work with many services in a repository that needs to be running to work as expected, we should have a way to run those builds automatically and restart the pods to take the new image.

Skaffold takes over to build all the images that you need, restart the pods and listen for more changes. With this, you can achieve a hot-building feature sending everything to minikube, the devs won\u2019t have to take care of this task. It was a win for them to find this tool.

Software-Defined IP Address Management (IPAM) IP Address Management (IPAM) fusionlayer.com: Software-Defined IP Address Management (IPAM) Cloud computing and service automation are changing the way in which applications and data are being delivered and consumed. The existing 30-year-old networking model is failing to keep up with the automated service architectures and the Internet of Things (IoT) based on end-to-end automation. To facilitate the migration to cloud-era computing, service providers and data centers must add networking into the automated service workflows. This requires agility and elasticity that traditional networking products are not designed to provide. As IT environments of tomorrow involve a plethora of orchestrators and controllers spinning up services and applications inside shared networks, they all must be managed and provisioned by a unified solution authoritative for all network-related information.

Network policy is expressed as a YAML configuration and works very well with GitOps. By adopting GitOps, security teams benefit in the following ways: Take your policies with you. Kubernetes cluster creation from code is fairly common. It is much easier and less error-prone to push your Git-based policies to a new cluster. You can monitor policy changes using information from pull requests. This will also be easy to integrate with your existing systems, instead of writing integrations from scratch. If something goes wrong, you can simply roll back to an earlier commit. You can lock down who can deploy security policies. If you lock it down to only a single Git user, that will be easy to control. Everybody else can push their policy changes into Git via pull request. Your GitOps tool can ensure that it will override any accidental or malicious change at runtime. This solves a major compliance concern. Git becomes the source of truth for your security policies. It would be much easier to manage if no user could create a security policy from kubectl. Then you can enable de-centralized security by creating specific users for different services, and giving them rights to deploy only specific policies. Developers and DevOps teams are very comfortable with the notion of a Git pipeline.

As IT environments of tomorrow involve a plethora of orchestrators and controllers spinning up services and applications inside shared networks, they all must be managed and provisioned by a unified solution authoritative for all network-related information.","title":"Software-Defined IP Address Management (IPAM)"},{"location":"kubernetes-networking/#cni-container-networking-interface","text":"Kubernetes.io: Network Plugins rancher.com: Container Network Interface (CNI) Providers github.com/containernetworking \ud83c\udf1f CNI dzone: How to Understand and Set Up Kubernetes Networking \ud83c\udf1f Take a look at this tutorial that goes through and explains the inner workings of Kubernetes networking, including working with multiple networks. medium: Container Networking Interface aka CNI itnext.io: Benchmark results of Kubernetes network plugins (CNI) over 10Gbit/s network (Updated: August 2020)","title":"CNI Container Networking Interface"},{"location":"kubernetes-networking/#list-of-existing-cni-plugins-ipam","text":"Kubernetes Networking Overlay Network plugins: Flannel Weave-net Routed Network Plugins: AWS-VPC kube-router Calico Canal VMware-tanzu Antrea IPAM modules: dhcp host-local Multi CNI plugins: Damn Multus CNI-Genie","title":"List of existing CNI Plugins (IPAM)"},{"location":"kubernetes-networking/#project-calico","text":"tigera.io Project Calico \ud83c\udf1f Secure networking for the cloud native era medium: Calico for Kubernetes networking: the basics & examples thenewstack.io: Tigera\u2019s Calico Aims to Ease Connectivity Pain with Kubernetes projectcalico.org: Advertising Kubernetes Service IPs with Calico and BGP mhmxs.blogspot.com: Autoscaling Calico Route Reflector topology in Kubernetes tigera.io: Enforcing Network Security Policies with GitOps \u2013 Part 1 (Calico + ArgoCD) Network policy is a key element of Kubernetes security. Network policy is expressed as a YAML configuration and works very well with GitOps. By adopting GitOps, security teams benefit in the following ways: Take your policies with you. Kubernetes cluster creation from code is fairly common. It is much easier and less error-prone to push your Git-based policies to a new cluster. You can monitor policy changes using information from pull requests. This will also be easy to integrate with your existing systems, instead of writing integrations from scratch. If something goes wrong, you can simply roll back to an earlier commit. You can lock down who can deploy security policies. If you lock it down to only a single Git user, that will be easy to control. Everybody else can push their policy changes into Git via pull request. Your GitOps tool can ensure that it will override any accidental or malicious change at runtime. This solves a major compliance concern. Git becomes the source of truth for your security policies. It would be much easier to manage if no user could create a security policy from kubectl. Then you can enable de-centralized security by creating specific users for different services, and giving them rights to deploy only specific policies. Developers and DevOps teams are very comfortable with the notion of a Git pipeline.","title":"Project Calico"},{"location":"kubernetes-networking/#dns-service-with-coredns","text":"medium: How to Autoscale the DNS Service in a Kubernetes Cluster thenewstack.io: Supercharge CoreDNS with Cluster Addons \ud83c\udf1f sysdig.com: How to monitor coreDNS \ud83c\udf1f The most common problems and outages in a Kubernetes cluster come from coreDNS, so learning how to monitor coreDNS is crucial. ungleich.ch: Making kubernetes kube-dns/CoreDNS publicly reachable","title":"DNS Service with CoreDNS"},{"location":"kubernetes-networking/#kubernetes-node-local-dns-cache","text":"NodeLocal DNSCache Kubernetes Node Local DNS Cache","title":"Kubernetes Node Local DNS Cache"},{"location":"kubernetes-networking/#kubernetes-sidecars","text":"banzaicloud.com: Sidecar container lifecycle changes in Kubernetes 1.18 \ud83c\udf1f medium: Delaying application start until sidecar is ready Taking advantage of a peculiar Kubernetes implementation detail to block containers from starting before another container starts.","title":"Kubernetes Sidecars"},{"location":"kubernetes-networking/#videos","text":"Click to expand!","title":"Videos"},{"location":"kubernetes-networking/#tweets","text":"Click to expand!

You can relate it to AWS instance roles and google cloud instance service account if you have a cloud background. By default, every pod gets assigned a default service account if you don\u2019t specify a custom service account. Service account allows pods to make calls to the API server to manage the cluster resources using ClusterRoles or resources scoped to a namespace using Roles. Also, you can use the Service account token from external applications to make API calls to the kubernetes API server. devopscube.com: How To Create Kubernetes Service Account For API Access devopscube.com: How to Create kubernetes Role for Service Account github.com/scriptcamp/kubernetes-serviceaccount-example Example Kubernetes manifests to create service account mapped to Rolebinding. medium: Working with Service Account In Kubernetes \ud83c\udf1f How to configure a service account in Kubernetes and manage it? github.com/dvob/k8s-s2s-auth: Kubernetes Service Accounts \ud83c\udf1f Service accounts are well known in Kubernetes to access the Kubernets API from within the cluster.

Azure Placement Policy Scheduler Plugins Azure/placement-policy-scheduler-plugins Most of cloud environments today provides cluster admins with ephemeral nodes (VMs). These nodes typically cost significantly less but they offer less reliability than their regular counterpart. Cluster admins are often torn between the choice of cost and reliability because of the innate inability of the default Kubernetes scheduler to place some of a specific workload pods on these nodes. Having the entire workload on ephemeral nodes risks the reliability of the workload when the cloud environment stops these nodes. This scheduler enables cluster admins to offload some configurable percentage of their workloads on these nodes enabling them to decrease the cost of running these pods without affecting its reliability.

If the Kubernetes Maturity Model is new to you, this is a helpful introduction and guide on how to use it. Before you do anything, consider what a cloud-native journey means to you and your organization. Kubernetes isn\u2019t right for everyone, so make sure you understand where to start and how to prove value by embracing Kubernetes. Any maturity model is a process, and you\u2019re likely to move back and forth between phases, and some will take longer than others. Even once you\u2019ve reached phase five, you\u2019ll always be working on ongoing optimization, removing human error and effort, and improving reliability and efficiency.

Yes, Zalando runs 100+ Kubernetes clusters on AWS. Each cluster runs in its own AWS account. They always create a pair of prod/non-prod clusters per \u201cproduct community\u201d, i.e. only half of their clusters (50+) are marked as \u201cproduction\u201d and have full 24x7 on-call support. They decided to go with \u201cmany\u201d (that\u2019s relative) clusters for various reasons: Kubernetes has no strong story for multi-tenancy, having \u201csmaller\u201d clusters mitigates part of this problem Some infrastructure is shared per cluster, e.g. Prometheus and the Ingress proxy (Skipper) \u2014 this requires appropriate (vertical) scaling of these components, smaller clusters make this easier to handle The blast radius is limited \u2014 anything going wrong in one cluster (outage, security incident, ..) does not necessarily affect the whole organization Cost attribution is easier (every cluster belongs to a cost center) The cluster (and its AWS account) serves as a natural trust boundary for access control (you can either deploy via CI/CD to a cluster or not) platform9.com: The Gorilla Guide to Kubernetes in the Enterprise Discover key capabilities for Kubernetes at scale.

After that came serverless and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where we said we could split those further by operations, giving us extreme scaling - because we can scale each operation individually. The author argues that maybe FaaS is not the best model - as functions are not the best model for implementing reasonably complex services where you want multiple operations to reside together when they have to interact with the same dataset. Probably, multi-runtime as the author calls it Mecha architecture, where you have your business logic in one container, and you have all the infrastructure-related concerns as a separate container. They jointly represent a multi-runtime microservice. Maybe that\u2019s a more suitable model because it has better properties. You get all the benefits of microservice. You still have all your domain, all the bounded contexts in one place. You have all the infrastructure and distributed application needs in a separate container, and you combine them at runtime.

Developers may also be responsible for some parts of Kubernetes configuration. As that process shifts left, developers need support to make the right decisions for the organization in order to run Kubernetes securely and efficiently. Many companies are adopting cloud native technologies to deliver speed to market. For businesses seeking to compete in today\u2019s marketplace, it\u2019s important to ship new features and meet customer needs where they are \u2014 and increasingly those needs are being met through software. weave.works: Production Ready Checklists for Kubernetes \ud83c\udf1f containerjournal.com: The Rise of the KubeMaster \ud83c\udf1f It wasn\u2019t obvious while it was happening, probably because everyone was focused on dealing with a global pandemic, but your IT environment became more complex. Cloud technology continued to evolve, and while that was happening, cloud use grew. Hybrid cloud use, already growing before the pandemic, became much more established with a year-over-year annual growth rate of 17.8%, according to Quince Market Insights. And with more distinct technology advances from each of the major cloud service providers, multi-cloud use also became more established. This more complex environment encouraged the use of containers, and Kubernetes became the preferred means of managing them. Unfortunately, the great irony of Kubernetes is that the technology created to make the management of modern cloud applications easier is, itself, incredibly difficult to manage. Just to deploy and manage a single application in your own data center requires working familiarity with a Kubernetes distribution and working integrations with a number of supporting systems and enterprise software including code registries, CI/CD, secrets management, storage management, networking, logging and monitoring, service mesh, backup and disaster recovery (DR). That\u2019s just for one environment. In a hybrid infrastructure, perhaps using one of the leading cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure or GCP, you could double this overhead. This rapid growth combined with immense complexity means not every Kubernetes implementation has been successful, and in the worst cases, misconfigurations have led to security breaches and significant application downtime. Overwhelmed teams with insufficient training only make the problem worse, putting these implementations farther behind as Kubernetes management becomes increasingly difficult. As such, I believe the time is now for a new role to emerge in the enterprise\u2014Kubernetes Manager . This is a job function that more and more companies will need to hire as operating and managing Kubernetes becomes a significantly larger part of the engineering operation than ever before.

For example: It stores our preferences, keeps track of window size and location, and remembers what files they have opened recently. Their Attributes are: persistence Storage gracefully deployment and scaling gracefully deletion and termination Automated rolling updates Stateless: A stateless application requests are self-contained, i.e. everything is contained within the request, and handled in two distinct phases - a \u201crequest\u201d and a \u201cresponse.\u201d Their Attributes are: Scaling can be done independently Mortal (Kubernetes Pods are mortal.

Why is Kubernetes service ownership emerging as the way for software delivery and operations teams to establish full \u201cownership\u201d of the services they support? Because ownership covers the lifespan of software from development to deployment to the sunsetting process. And this shift to full-spectrum accountability brings about dramatic improvements in the overall speed, reliability, security and cost of applications. Of course, it\u2019s not always easy to determine which organizations need this level of ownership. When businesses grow, they typically discover that pushing the delivery of applications and services through a gate of operations is challenging at best, impossible at worst. Even so, the DevSecOps mindset is on the rise, which means teams are now seeking ways to make this type of shift into more meaningful and effective ownership. It is the shift that enables a deep fundamental change to occur within an organization. itnext.io: Kubernetes \u2014 Running Multiple Container Runtimes In this post, you\u2019ll learn how to run multiple OCI container runtimes on Kubernetes.

For example, if I wanted to add particular labels to all the pods that are created, it could be done by a mutating webhook which watches for all CREATE POD events and adds the labels to that pod before it gets deployed. Why: As the development teams put larger workloads into Kubernetes, managing all of the resources becomes quite difficult as there may be different deployment patterns and life cycles. Mutating webhooks give you the ability to target changes to any Kubernetes resource regardless of their deployment mechanisms and alter them before or after any point within the life cycle. Some use cases where it could be used include: Metadata management: include useful metadata about team, environment or type of workload to each Kubernetes resource Attaching sidecar processes: add a log listener to particular pods Secret management: apply consistent secret retrieval across all resources Deployment configuration: could add environment variables or configmaps on the fly to pods Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager medium: The Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager Kubernetes Resources medium: Kubernetes Resources \ud83c\udf1f enterprisersproject.com: Managing Kubernetes resources: 5 things to remember Kubernetes automates much of the work of managing containers at scale.

Extending Kubernetes Adding Custom Resources. Extending Kubernetes API with Kubernetes Resource Definitions. CRD vs Aggregated API Custom Resources itnext.io: CRD is just a table in Kubernetes Use a custom resource (CRD or Aggregated API) if most of the following apply: You want to use Kubernetes client libraries and CLIs to create and update the new resource. You want top-level support from kubectl; for example, kubectl get my-object object-name. You want to build new automation that watches for updates on the new object, and then CRUD other objects, or vice versa. You want to write automation that handles updates to the object. You want to use Kubernetes API conventions like .spec, .status, and .metadata. You want the object to be an abstraction over a collection of controlled resources, or a summarization of other resources. Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to your cluster: CRDs are simple and can be created without any programming. API Aggregation requires programming, but allows more control over API behaviors like how data is stored and conversion between API versions. Kubernetes provides these two options to meet the needs of different users, so that neither ease of use nor flexibility is compromised. Aggregated APIs are subordinate API servers that sit behind the primary API server, which acts as a proxy. This arrangement is called API Aggregation (AA). To users, it simply appears that the Kubernetes API is extended. CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server. You do not need to understand API Aggregation to use CRDs. Regardless of how they are installed, the new resources are referred to as Custom Resources to distinguish them from built-in Kubernetes resources (like pods).

Building new applications requires writing a good amount of boilerplate config, copying code from other projects, and applying manual tweaks and customizations. As applications evolve and teams grow, these YAML files become harder to manage. Sharing best practices or making updates involves manual changes and complex migrations. YAML is an excellent format for describing the desired state of your cluster, but it is does not have primitives for expressing logic and reusable abstractions. There are multiple tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem which attempt to address these gaps in various ways: kustomize Customization of kubernetes YAML configurations jsonnet data templating language jsonnet.org jkcfg Configuration as Code with ECMAScript jkcfg.github.io kubecfg A tool for managing complex enterprise Kubernetes environments as code. kubegen Simple way to describe Kubernetes resources in a structured way, but without new syntax or magic Pulumi We realized this was exactly the same problem our customers had faced when defining their applications through CloudFormation templates, a problem solved by the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) , and that we could apply the same design concepts from the AWS CDK to help all Kubernetes users.

After that came serverless and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where we said we could split those further by operations, giving us extreme scaling - because we can scale each operation individually. The author argues that maybe FaaS is not the best model - as functions are not the best model for implementing reasonably complex services where you want multiple operations to reside together when they have to interact with the same dataset. Probably, multi-runtime as the author calls it Mecha architecture, where you have your business logic in one container, and you have all the infrastructure-related concerns as a separate container. They jointly represent a multi-runtime microservice. Maybe that\u2019s a more suitable model because it has better properties. You get all the benefits of microservice. You still have all your domain, all the bounded contexts in one place. You have all the infrastructure and distributed application needs in a separate container, and you combine them at runtime.

Developers may also be responsible for some parts of Kubernetes configuration. As that process shifts left, developers need support to make the right decisions for the organization in order to run Kubernetes securely and efficiently. Many companies are adopting cloud native technologies to deliver speed to market. For businesses seeking to compete in today\u2019s marketplace, it\u2019s important to ship new features and meet customer needs where they are \u2014 and increasingly those needs are being met through software. weave.works: Production Ready Checklists for Kubernetes \ud83c\udf1f containerjournal.com: The Rise of the KubeMaster \ud83c\udf1f It wasn\u2019t obvious while it was happening, probably because everyone was focused on dealing with a global pandemic, but your IT environment became more complex. Cloud technology continued to evolve, and while that was happening, cloud use grew. Hybrid cloud use, already growing before the pandemic, became much more established with a year-over-year annual growth rate of 17.8%, according to Quince Market Insights. And with more distinct technology advances from each of the major cloud service providers, multi-cloud use also became more established. This more complex environment encouraged the use of containers, and Kubernetes became the preferred means of managing them. Unfortunately, the great irony of Kubernetes is that the technology created to make the management of modern cloud applications easier is, itself, incredibly difficult to manage. Just to deploy and manage a single application in your own data center requires working familiarity with a Kubernetes distribution and working integrations with a number of supporting systems and enterprise software including code registries, CI/CD, secrets management, storage management, networking, logging and monitoring, service mesh, backup and disaster recovery (DR). That\u2019s just for one environment. In a hybrid infrastructure, perhaps using one of the leading cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure or GCP, you could double this overhead. This rapid growth combined with immense complexity means not every Kubernetes implementation has been successful, and in the worst cases, misconfigurations have led to security breaches and significant application downtime. Overwhelmed teams with insufficient training only make the problem worse, putting these implementations farther behind as Kubernetes management becomes increasingly difficult. As such, I believe the time is now for a new role to emerge in the enterprise\u2014Kubernetes Manager .

There are two types: Stateful and Stateless Applications. Stateful: A stateful application can remember at least some of the things(from the past) about its state when it runs each time. For example: It stores our preferences, keeps track of window size and location, and remembers what files they have opened recently. Their Attributes are: persistence Storage gracefully deployment and scaling gracefully deletion and termination Automated rolling updates Stateless: A stateless application requests are self-contained, i.e. everything is contained within the request, and handled in two distinct phases - a \u201crequest\u201d and a \u201cresponse.\u201d Their Attributes are: Scaling can be done independently Mortal (Kubernetes Pods are mortal. They are born and when they die, they are not resurrected) No persistence Storage Client Cookies can be used to make service stateless cncf.io: Advanced Kubernetes pod to node scheduling In this article, you\u2019ll review some of the use cases for advanced pod scheduling in Kubernetes as well as best practices for implementing it in real-world situations. medium: Create A Pod In Kubernetes Cluster Learn what is Pod and how to create a Pod in the Kubernetes cluster. cloudsavvyit.com: How to Scale Docker Containers Across Servers Using Kubernetes Kubernetes.

Why is Kubernetes service ownership emerging as the way for software delivery and operations teams to establish full \u201cownership\u201d of the services they support? Because ownership covers the lifespan of software from development to deployment to the sunsetting process. And this shift to full-spectrum accountability brings about dramatic improvements in the overall speed, reliability, security and cost of applications. Of course, it\u2019s not always easy to determine which organizations need this level of ownership. When businesses grow, they typically discover that pushing the delivery of applications and services through a gate of operations is challenging at best, impossible at worst. Even so, the DevSecOps mindset is on the rise, which means teams are now seeking ways to make this type of shift into more meaningful and effective ownership. It is the shift that enables a deep fundamental change to occur within an organization. itnext.io: Kubernetes \u2014 Running Multiple Container Runtimes In this post, you\u2019ll learn how to run multiple OCI container runtimes on Kubernetes.

For example, if I wanted to add particular labels to all the pods that are created, it could be done by a mutating webhook which watches for all CREATE POD events and adds the labels to that pod before it gets deployed. Why: As the development teams put larger workloads into Kubernetes, managing all of the resources becomes quite difficult as there may be different deployment patterns and life cycles. Mutating webhooks give you the ability to target changes to any Kubernetes resource regardless of their deployment mechanisms and alter them before or after any point within the life cycle. Some use cases where it could be used include: Metadata management: include useful metadata about team, environment or type of workload to each Kubernetes resource Attaching sidecar processes: add a log listener to particular pods Secret management: apply consistent secret retrieval across all resources Deployment configuration: could add environment variables or configmaps on the fly to pods","title":"Kubernetes Mutating Webhooks"},{"location":"kubernetes/#kubernetes-cloud-controller-manager","text":"medium: The Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager","title":"Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager"},{"location":"kubernetes/#kubernetes-resources","text":"medium: Kubernetes Resources \ud83c\udf1f enterprisersproject.com: Managing Kubernetes resources: 5 things to remember Kubernetes automates much of the work of managing containers at scale.

You want top-level support from kubectl; for example, kubectl get my-object object-name. You want to build new automation that watches for updates on the new object, and then CRUD other objects, or vice versa. You want to write automation that handles updates to the object. You want to use Kubernetes API conventions like .spec, .status, and .metadata. You want the object to be an abstraction over a collection of controlled resources, or a summarization of other resources. Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to your cluster: CRDs are simple and can be created without any programming. API Aggregation requires programming, but allows more control over API behaviors like how data is stored and conversion between API versions. Kubernetes provides these two options to meet the needs of different users, so that neither ease of use nor flexibility is compromised. Aggregated APIs are subordinate API servers that sit behind the primary API server, which acts as a proxy. This arrangement is called API Aggregation (AA). To users, it simply appears that the Kubernetes API is extended. CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server. You do not need to understand API Aggregation to use CRDs.

Because they work independently, they can be added, removed, or upgraded without interfering with other applications. While there are numerous benefits to microservices architecture, like easier deployment and testing, improved productivity, flexibility, and scalability, they also pose a few disadvantages, as independently run microservices require a seamless method of communication to operate as one larger application. Event-driven microservices allow for real-time microservices communication, enabling data to be consumed in the form of events before they\u2019re even requested. In this white paper, we\u2019ll cover how event-driven microservices work, presenting a sample currency exchange platform to illustrate the design and architecture of an application composed of event-driven microservices using Apache Kafka\u00ae and Confluent Platform. We also discuss other aspects of microservices architectures, such as team structure, continuous delivery, deployment, and testing. Lastly, we discuss how Apache Kafka and Confluent Platform enable and extend core principles of microservices, including decoupling, separation of concerns, agility, and real-time streaming of event data. redhat.com: Event-driven architecture: Understanding the essential benefits \ud83c\udf1f Event-driven architectures bring significant benefits when managing many endpoints, but it also has its complexities to be aware of. medium: Introduction to Message Queues \ud83c\udf1f headspring.com: Is Kafka or RabbitMQ the right messaging tool for you? dzone: Why Pub/Sub Isn\u2019t Enough for Modern Apps Pub/Sub is the most appropriate way of architecting the delivery side of an event-driven architecture (especially for the web). baeldung.com: Pub-Sub vs. Message Queues \ud83c\udf1f engineering.atspotify.com: Spotify\u2019s Event Delivery \u2013 The Road to the Cloud (Part I) medium: Monolithic to Microservices Architecture with Patterns & Best Practices \ud83c\udf1f infoq.com: Turning Microservices Inside-Out towardsdatascience.com: Architecture for High-Throughput Low-Latency Big Data Pipeline on Cloud \ud83c\udf1f Scalable and efficient data pipelines are as important for the success of analytics, data science, and machine learning as reliable supply lines are for winning a war. dzone: RESTful Applications in An Event-Driven Architecture Hybrid architecture with both RESTful and event-driven services. developers.redhat.com: Distributed transaction patterns for microservices compared thenewstack.io: The Rise of Event-Driven Architecture jinwookim928.medium.com: Why Not Event Driven Architecture? thenewstack.io: Streaming Data and the Modern Real-Time Data Stack Modern Data Stack Modern Real-Time Data Stack Language SQL SQL Deployment Cloud-native Cloud-native Data Ops Complex batch transformations every 15 minutes, hourly or daily Simple incremental transformations every second Insights Monthly, Weekly or Daily Instantly Cost Affordable at massive scale Affordable at massive scale and speed blog.direktiv.io: Event driven orchestration with Knative (part 1) blog.direktiv.io: Redefining event-driven orchestration for automation & applications pub.towardsai.net: Deep Dive into Event-Driven architecture | Gul Ershad developer.com: An Introduction to Event Driven Microservices dzone.com: What Are Microservices and The Event Aggregator Pattern? \ud83c\udf1f Learn about the Event Aggregator pattern for organizing event communication in a microservices architecture with an example. ibm.com: Event-driven cloud-native applications (microservices) The event backbone is being part of the microservices mesh, providing the publish-and-subscribe communication between microservices and enabling the support of loosely coupled event-driven microservices. irfanyusanif.medium.com: Best practices to communicate between microservices swapnil-chougule.medium.com: Rapid Feature Engineering through SQL blog.twitter.com: Processing billions of events in real time at Twitter codeopinion.com: Event Sourcing vs Event Driven Architecture RPC vs Messaging particular.net: RPC vs. Messaging \u2013 which is faster?

Because they work independently, they can be added, removed, or upgraded without interfering with other applications. While there are numerous benefits to microservices architecture, like easier deployment and testing, improved productivity, flexibility, and scalability, they also pose a few disadvantages, as independently run microservices require a seamless method of communication to operate as one larger application. Event-driven microservices allow for real-time microservices communication, enabling data to be consumed in the form of events before they\u2019re even requested. In this white paper, we\u2019ll cover how event-driven microservices work, presenting a sample currency exchange platform to illustrate the design and architecture of an application composed of event-driven microservices using Apache Kafka\u00ae and Confluent Platform. We also discuss other aspects of microservices architectures, such as team structure, continuous delivery, deployment, and testing. Lastly, we discuss how Apache Kafka and Confluent Platform enable and extend core principles of microservices, including decoupling, separation of concerns, agility, and real-time streaming of event data. redhat.com: Event-driven architecture: Understanding the essential benefits \ud83c\udf1f Event-driven architectures bring significant benefits when managing many endpoints, but it also has its complexities to be aware of. medium: Introduction to Message Queues \ud83c\udf1f headspring.com: Is Kafka or RabbitMQ the right messaging tool for you? dzone: Why Pub/Sub Isn\u2019t Enough for Modern Apps Pub/Sub is the most appropriate way of architecting the delivery side of an event-driven architecture (especially for the web). baeldung.com: Pub-Sub vs. Message Queues \ud83c\udf1f engineering.atspotify.com: Spotify\u2019s Event Delivery \u2013 The Road to the Cloud (Part I) medium: Monolithic to Microservices Architecture with Patterns & Best Practices \ud83c\udf1f infoq.com: Turning Microservices Inside-Out towardsdatascience.com: Architecture for High-Throughput Low-Latency Big Data Pipeline on Cloud \ud83c\udf1f Scalable and efficient data pipelines are as important for the success of analytics, data science, and machine learning as reliable supply lines are for winning a war. dzone: RESTful Applications in An Event-Driven Architecture Hybrid architecture with both RESTful and event-driven services. developers.redhat.com: Distributed transaction patterns for microservices compared thenewstack.io: The Rise of Event-Driven Architecture jinwookim928.medium.com: Why Not Event Driven Architecture? thenewstack.io: Streaming Data and the Modern Real-Time Data Stack Modern Data Stack Modern Real-Time Data Stack Language SQL SQL Deployment Cloud-native Cloud-native Data Ops Complex batch transformations every 15 minutes, hourly or daily Simple incremental transformations every second Insights Monthly, Weekly or Daily Instantly Cost Affordable at massive scale Affordable at massive scale and speed blog.direktiv.io: Event driven orchestration with Knative (part 1) blog.direktiv.io: Redefining event-driven orchestration for automation & applications pub.towardsai.net: Deep Dive into Event-Driven architecture | Gul Ershad developer.com: An Introduction to Event Driven Microservices dzone.com: What Are Microservices and The Event Aggregator Pattern? \ud83c\udf1f Learn about the Event Aggregator pattern for organizing event communication in a microservices architecture with an example. ibm.com: Event-driven cloud-native applications (microservices) The event backbone is being part of the microservices mesh, providing the publish-and-subscribe communication between microservices and enabling the support of loosely coupled event-driven microservices. irfanyusanif.medium.com: Best practices to communicate between microservices swapnil-chougule.medium.com: Rapid Feature Engineering through SQL blog.twitter.com: Processing billions of events in real time at Twitter codeopinion.com: Event Sourcing vs Event Driven Architecture","title":"Message Queue in Kubernetes.

The configuration providers in this repo can be used to load data from Kubernetes Secrets and Config Maps. It can be used in all Kafka components and does not depend on the other Strimzi components. So you could, for example, use it with your producer or consumer applications even if you don\u2019t use the Strimzi operators to provide your Kafka cluster.

When you have a huge number of applications talking to each other there is an enormous amount of logs that they produce. Handling this amount of logs can be very costly and a headache. Let\u2019s look at this problem for handling your logs at scale and Logging infrastructure System Design. medium.com: Monitoring Microservices - Part 1: Observability | Anderson Carvalho Achieving observability with probes, logs, metrics, and traces. The Observability Pyramid comprises Probes, Logs, Metrics, and Traces: Probes: Probes are often exposed as endpoints and used by external agents like load balancers, container orchestrators, application servers, and sysadmins before deciding what to do next. The most common probes are starting, ready, and live. The startup probe is on during the component bootstrap phase. The liveness probe is on from the time the component starts until it stops running. The readiness probe is on during the period where the component is ready/open to receive requests or process workload. Logs: Logs are messages produced during the component execution that capture a piece of relevant information. Usually, we classify log messages into all, debug, info, warn, error, and fatal. Logs can produce a huge amount of data and contain sensitive information. A good practice is to apply different log levels depending on the environment. Log Aggregation: Each component generates one or more log files. Since distributed systems are composed of multiples components, it\u2019s a daunting and miserable task to dig into a bunch of log files during troubleshooting. Thus, log aggregation is highly recommended for Microservices. Metrics: Metrics give us the visibility of good and bad events that happen inside of an application. Metrics help us to distinguish between normal and abnormal application behavior. Usually, we collect, count, summarize and compare events related to rate, errors, duration, and saturation to produce metrics. Traces: Traces record the flow of data between different components and execution details of each one along the way. By tracing we can discover the relationships, dependencies between components, identify bottlenecks, comprehend the data flow, and the time span on each component. infoworld.com: The RED method: A new strategy for monitoring microservices By using the RED metrics\u2014rate, error, and duration\u2014you can get a solid understanding of how your services are performing for end-users. intellipaat.com: Top 10 DevOps Monitoring Tools Are you a DevOps engineer?

Many organizations may want to add new custom dashboards. This custom grafana will interact with existing Prometheus and will also add all out-of-the-box dashboards plus few more interesting dashboards which may require from day to day operation. Custom Grafana pod uses OpenShift oAuth to authenticate users and assigns \u201cAdmin\u201d role to all users so that users can create their own dashboards for additional monitoring. Getting Started with Custom Dashboarding on OpenShift using Grafana . This repository contains scaffolding and automation for developing a custom dashboarding strategy on OpenShift using the OpenShift Monitoring stac Capacity Management Grafana Dashboard This repo adds a capacity management Grafana dashboard. The intent of this dashboard is to answer a single question: Do I need a new node? . We believe this is the most important question when setting up a capacity management process. We are aware that this is not the only question a capacity management process may need to be able to answer. Thus, this should be considered as the starting point for organizations to build their capacity management process. Software Delivery Metrics Grafana Dashboard This repo contains tooling to help organizations measure Software Delivery and Value Stream metrics. Prometheus for OpenShift 3.11 This repo contains example components for running either an operational Prometheus setup for your OpenShift cluster, or deploying a standalone secured Prometheus instance for configurating yourself. OpenShift 4 OpenShift Container Platform includes a pre-configured, pre-installed, and self-updating monitoring stack that is based on the Prometheus open source project and its wider eco-system. It provides monitoring of cluster components and includes a set of alerts to immediately notify the cluster administrator about any occurring problems and a set of Grafana dashboards. The cluster monitoring stack is only supported for monitoring OpenShift Container Platform clusters. OpenShift Cluster Monitoring components cannot be extended since they are read only.

Tracing is about analyzing, recording, and describing transactions. Distributed Tracing: Troubleshooting requests between interconnected cloud-based microservices can\u2019t always be done with logs and metrics alone. This is where distributed tracing comes into play: It provides developers with a detailed view of individual requests as they \u201chop\u201d through a system of microservices. With distributed tracing you can: Trace the path of a request as it travels across a complex system. Discover the latency of the components along that path. Know which component in the path is creating a bottleneck or failure. Performance: Latency is a very important metric in microservices. Latency problems in one service will impact the overall request latency when chaining calls to different microservices. Every call to a microservice should record a trace, which is basically a record of how much time it took to respond. It\u2019s possible to add more details to the function level, including the action, the result, and the pass to the next service. The hard part is triaging all traces in a request from a client. Usually, a trace ID header has to be sent in every request. If there isn\u2019t one, the logging library creates it and it will represent the first trace in a request. Adding traces with OpenCensus is simply a matter of including the libraries and registering an exporter. Monitoring in a Microservices/Kubernetes World: In distributed system architectures like microservices, having visibility from different perspectives will be critical at troubleshooting time. Many things could happen in a request when there are many parts constantly interacting at the same time. The most common method is to write logs to the stdout and stderr streams. For example, a latency problem in the system could exist because a microservice is not responding correctly. Maybe Kubernetes is restarting the pod too frequently, or perhaps the cluster is out of capacity and can\u2019t schedule any more pods. But for this reason, tools like Istio exist; by injecting a container in every pod, you can get a pretty good baseline of telemetry. Additionally, when you add instrumentation with libraries like OpenCensus , you can deeply understand what\u2019s happening with and within each service. All this information will need a storage location, and as a good practice, you might want to have it a centralized location to provide access to anyone in the team \u2014 not just for the operations team.

The AMQ Broker Prometheus plugin exports the broker runtime metrics to Prometheus format , enabling you to use Prometheus itself to visualize and run queries on the data. You can also use a graphical tool, such as Grafana, to configure more advanced visualizations and dashboards for the metrics that the Prometheus plugin collects. The metrics that the plugin exports to Prometheus format are listed below. A description of each metric is exported along with the metric itself. ref1 , ref2 , ref3 Red Hat AMQ Streams (Kafka) JMX , OpenTracing+Jaeger ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka clients all expose management information using Java Management Extensions (JMX) . Most management information is in the form of metrics that are useful for monitoring the condition and performance of your Kafka cluster. Like other Java applications, Kafka provides this management information through managed beans or MBeans. JMX works at the level of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). To obtain management information, external tools can connect to the JVM that is running ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, and so on. By default, only tools on the same machine and running as the same user as the JVM are able to connect. Distributed Tracing with Jaeger: - Kafka Producers, Kafka Consumers, and Kafka Streams applications (referred to as Kafka clients) - MirrorMaker and Kafka Connect - Kafka Bridge ref1 , ref2 Red Hat AMQ Streams Operator AMQ Streams Operator (Prometheus & Jaeger), strimzi, jmxtrans How to monitor AMQ Streams Kafka, Zookeeper and Kafka Connect clusters using Prometheus to provide monitoring data for example Grafana dashboards. Support for distributed tracing in AMQ Streams, using Jaeger : - You instrument Kafka Producer, Consumer, and Streams API applications for distributed tracing using an OpenTracing client library. This involves adding instrumentation code to these clients, which monitors the execution of individual transactions in order to generate trace data. - Distributed tracing support is built in to the Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker, and Kafka Bridge components of AMQ Streams. To configure these components for distributed tracing, you configure and update the relevant custom resources. ref1 , ref2 , ref3 strimzi , ref4: jmxtrans , ref5: banzai operator Red Hat AMQ Broker Operator Prometheus (recommended) or Jolokia REST to JMX To monitor runtime data for brokers in your deployment, use one of these approaches: - Section 9.1, \u201cMonitoring broker runtime data using Prometheus\u201d - Section 9.2, \u201cMonitoring broker runtime data using JMX\u201d In general, using Prometheus is the recommended approach.

Let\u2019s look at this problem for handling your logs at scale and Logging infrastructure System Design. medium.com: Monitoring Microservices - Part 1: Observability | Anderson Carvalho Achieving observability with probes, logs, metrics, and traces. The Observability Pyramid comprises Probes, Logs, Metrics, and Traces: Probes: Probes are often exposed as endpoints and used by external agents like load balancers, container orchestrators, application servers, and sysadmins before deciding what to do next. The most common probes are starting, ready, and live. The startup probe is on during the component bootstrap phase. The liveness probe is on from the time the component starts until it stops running. The readiness probe is on during the period where the component is ready/open to receive requests or process workload. Logs: Logs are messages produced during the component execution that capture a piece of relevant information. Usually, we classify log messages into all, debug, info, warn, error, and fatal. Logs can produce a huge amount of data and contain sensitive information. A good practice is to apply different log levels depending on the environment. Log Aggregation: Each component generates one or more log files. Since distributed systems are composed of multiples components, it\u2019s a daunting and miserable task to dig into a bunch of log files during troubleshooting. Thus, log aggregation is highly recommended for Microservices. Metrics: Metrics give us the visibility of good and bad events that happen inside of an application. Metrics help us to distinguish between normal and abnormal application behavior. Usually, we collect, count, summarize and compare events related to rate, errors, duration, and saturation to produce metrics. Traces: Traces record the flow of data between different components and execution details of each one along the way. By tracing we can discover the relationships, dependencies between components, identify bottlenecks, comprehend the data flow, and the time span on each component. infoworld.com: The RED method: A new strategy for monitoring microservices By using the RED metrics\u2014rate, error, and duration\u2014you can get a solid understanding of how your services are performing for end-users. intellipaat.com: Top 10 DevOps Monitoring Tools Are you a DevOps engineer?

Tracing is about analyzing, recording, and describing transactions. Distributed Tracing: Troubleshooting requests between interconnected cloud-based microservices can\u2019t always be done with logs and metrics alone. This is where distributed tracing comes into play: It provides developers with a detailed view of individual requests as they \u201chop\u201d through a system of microservices. With distributed tracing you can: Trace the path of a request as it travels across a complex system. Discover the latency of the components along that path. Know which component in the path is creating a bottleneck or failure. Performance: Latency is a very important metric in microservices. Latency problems in one service will impact the overall request latency when chaining calls to different microservices. Every call to a microservice should record a trace, which is basically a record of how much time it took to respond. It\u2019s possible to add more details to the function level, including the action, the result, and the pass to the next service. The hard part is triaging all traces in a request from a client. Usually, a trace ID header has to be sent in every request. If there isn\u2019t one, the logging library creates it and it will represent the first trace in a request. Adding traces with OpenCensus is simply a matter of including the libraries and registering an exporter. Monitoring in a Microservices/Kubernetes World: In distributed system architectures like microservices, having visibility from different perspectives will be critical at troubleshooting time. Many things could happen in a request when there are many parts constantly interacting at the same time. The most common method is to write logs to the stdout and stderr streams. For example, a latency problem in the system could exist because a microservice is not responding correctly. Maybe Kubernetes is restarting the pod too frequently, or perhaps the cluster is out of capacity and can\u2019t schedule any more pods. But for this reason, tools like Istio exist; by injecting a container in every pod, you can get a pretty good baseline of telemetry. Additionally, when you add instrumentation with libraries like OpenCensus , you can deeply understand what\u2019s happening with and within each service. All this information will need a storage location, and as a good practice, you might want to have it a centralized location to provide access to anyone in the team \u2014 not just for the operations team.

Prometheus is software built for monitoring large, scalable systems and storing historical runtime data over an extended time period. The AMQ Broker Prometheus plugin exports the broker runtime metrics to Prometheus format , enabling you to use Prometheus itself to visualize and run queries on the data. You can also use a graphical tool, such as Grafana, to configure more advanced visualizations and dashboards for the metrics that the Prometheus plugin collects. The metrics that the plugin exports to Prometheus format are listed below. A description of each metric is exported along with the metric itself. ref1 , ref2 , ref3 Red Hat AMQ Streams (Kafka) JMX , OpenTracing+Jaeger ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka clients all expose management information using Java Management Extensions (JMX) . Most management information is in the form of metrics that are useful for monitoring the condition and performance of your Kafka cluster. Like other Java applications, Kafka provides this management information through managed beans or MBeans. JMX works at the level of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). To obtain management information, external tools can connect to the JVM that is running ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, and so on. By default, only tools on the same machine and running as the same user as the JVM are able to connect.

This involves adding instrumentation code to these clients, which monitors the execution of individual transactions in order to generate trace data. - Distributed tracing support is built in to the Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker, and Kafka Bridge components of AMQ Streams.

Not concerned with the creation of the required resources; users can choose to manually create these resources using the CLI, or users can choose to create these resources using the Catalog Operator. Catalog Operator : Responsible for resolving and installing CSVs and the required resources they specify. It is also responsible for watching CatalogSources for updates to packages in channels and upgrading them (optionally automatically) to the latest available versions. A user that wishes to track a package in a channel creates a Subscription resource configuring the desired package, channel, and the CatalogSource from which to pull updates. When updates are found, an appropriate InstallPlan is written into the namespace on behalf of the user. Automated Infrastructure Management ( Over-The-Air Updates ) New Technical Components New Installer : try.openshift.com github.com/openshift/installer Storage: Cloud integrated storage capability used by default via OCS Operator (Red Hat) There are a number of persistent storage options available to you through the OperatorHub / Storage vendors that don\u2019t involve Red Hat, NFS or Gluster. Kubernetes-native persistent storage technologies available (non-RedHat solutions): Rook-Ceph : Rook-Ceph storage Operator now on OperatorHub.io Robin Storage Operator : get.robin.io Operators End-To-End!: responsible for reconciling the system to the desired state Cluster configuration kept as API objects that ease its maintenance (\u201ceverything-as-code\u201d approach): Every component is configured with Custom Resources (CR) that are processed by operators. No more painful upgrades and synchronization among multiple nodes and no more configuration drift. List of operators that configure cluster components (API objects): API server Nodes via Machine API Ingress Internal DNS Logging (EFK) and Monitoring (Prometheus) Sample applications Networking Internal Registry Oauth (and authentication in general) etc At the Node Level: RHEL CoreOS is the result of merging CoreOS Container Linux and RedHat Atomic host functionality and is currently the only supported OS to host OpenShift 4.

Terraform. 2 installation patterns: Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI) User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI) The whole process can be done in one command and requires minimal infrastructure knowledge (IPI): openshift-install create cluster IPI and UPI 2 installation patterns: Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI): On supported platforms, the installer is capable of provisioning the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. The installer programmatically creates all portions of the networking, machines, and operating systems required to support the cluster. Think of it as best-practice reference architecture implemented in code. It is recommended that most users make use of this functionality to avoid having to provision their own infrastructure. The installer will create and destroy the infrastructure components it needs to be successful over the life of the cluster. User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI): For other platforms or in scenarios where installer provisioned infrastructure would be incompatible, the installer can stop short of creating the infrastructure, and allow the platform administrator to provision their own using the cluster assets generated by the install tool. Once the infrastructure has been created, OpenShift 4 is installed, maintaining its ability to support automated operations and over-the-air platform updates. Cluster Autoscaler Operator Adjusts the size of an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to meet its current deployment needs. It uses declarative, Kubernetes-style arguments Increases the size of the cluster when there are pods that failed to schedule on any of the current nodes due to insufficient resources or when another node is necessary to meet deployment needs. The ClusterAutoscaler does not increase the cluster resources beyond the limits that you specify. A huge improvement over the manual, error-prone process used in the previous version of OpenShift and RHEL nodes. Operators Introduction Core of the platform The hierarchy of operators, with clusterversion at the top, is the single door for configuration changes and is responsible for reconciling the system to the desired state. For example, if you break a critical cluster resource directly, the system automatically recovers itself. Similarly to cluster maintenance, operator framework used for applications. As a user, you get SDK, OLM (Lifecycle Manager of all Operators and their associated services running across their clusters) and embedded operator hub .

Routers in OCP4: Ingress Controller is the most common way to allow external access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster Configuring Ingress Operator in OCP4 Limited to HTTP, HTTPS using SNI, and TLS using SNI (sufficient for web applications and services) Has two replicas by default, which means it should be running on two worker nodes. Can be scaled up to have more replicas on more nodes. The Ingress Operator implements the ingresscontroller API and is the component responsible for enabling external access to OpenShift Container Platform cluster services. The operator makes this possible by deploying and managing one or more HAProxy-based Ingress Controllers to handle routing.

Next-Generation Container Image Building Tools Redesign of how images are built on the platform. Instead of relying on a daemon on the host to manage containers, image creation, and image pushing, we are leveraging Buildah running inside our build pods. This aligns with the general OpenShift 4 theme of making everything \u201cjust another pod\u201d A simplified set of build workflows, not dependent on the node host having a specific container runtime available. Dockerfiles that built under OpenShift 3.x will continue to build under OpenShift 4.x and S2I builds will continue to function as well. The actual BuildConfig API is unchanged, so a BuildConfig from a v3.x cluster can be imported into a v4.x cluster and work without modification.

SDN/CNI plug-ins Networking in OCP4 Currently, the default OpenShift CNI is OpenShift SDN (network-policy) , which configures an overlay network using Open vSwitch (OVS 2.11). The following diagram shows the CNI options for OpenShift and the status of each (supported, validated, etc. \u2026): redhat.com: Network traffic control for containers in Red Hat OpenShift Multiple Networks with SDN/CNI plug-ins. Usage scenarios for an additional network Understanding multiple networks In Kubernetes, container networking is delegated to networking plug-ins that implement the Container Network Interface (CNI). OpenShift Container Platform uses the Multus CNI plug-in to allow chaining of CNI plug-ins. During cluster installation, you configure your default Pod network. The default network handles all ordinary network traffic for the cluster. You can define an additional network based on the available CNI plug-ins and attach one or more of these networks to your Pods. You can define more than one additional network for your cluster, depending on your needs. This gives you flexibility when you configure Pods that deliver network functionality, such as switching or routing. You can use an additional network in situations where network isolation is needed, including data plane and control plane separation. Isolating network traffic is useful for the following performance and security reasons: Performance: You can send traffic on two different planes in order to manage how much traffic is along each plane. Security: You can send sensitive traffic onto a network plane that is managed specifically for security considerations, and you can separate private data that must not be shared between tenants or customers. All of the Pods in the cluster still use the cluster-wide default network to maintain connectivity across the cluster. Every Pod has an eth0 interface that is attached to the cluster-wide Pod network. You can view the interfaces for a Pod by using the oc exec -it \u2013 ip a command. If you add additional network interfaces that use Multus CNI, they are named net1, net2, \u2026\u200b, netN. To attach additional network interfaces to a Pod, you must create configurations that define how the interfaces are attached. You specify each interface by using a Custom Resource (CR) that has a NetworkAttachmentDefinition type. A CNI configuration inside each of these CRs defines how that interface is created. openshift.com: Demystifying Multus \ud83c\udf1f Istio CNI plug-in Istio CNI plug-in \ud83c\udf1f Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh includes CNI plug-in, which provides you with an alternate way to configure application pod networking.

An image stream is an abstraction for referencing container images from within OpenShift while the referenced images are an image registry such as OpenShift internal registry, Quay, or other external registries. Image streams are capable of defining triggers which allow your builds and deployments to be automatically invoked when a new version of an image is available in the backing image registry. This in effect enables rebuilding all images that are based on a particular base image as soon as a new version of the base image is available in the Red Hat container catalog and therefore updates all images with the latest bug, CVE, and vulnerability fixes delivered in the latest base image. The challenge, however, is that this capability is limited to BuildConfigs in OpenShift and does not allow more complex workflows to be triggered when images are updated in the Red Hat container catalog. Furthermore, it is also limited to the scope of a single cluster and its internal OpenShift registry. Fortunately, though, using Red Hat Quay as a central registry in combination with OpenShift Pipelines enables infinite possibilities in designing sophisticated workflows for ensuring a secure software supply chain and automatically performing any set of actions whenever images are pushed, updated, or security vulnerabilities are discovered in the Red Hat container catalog. In this blog post, we will highlight how Red Hat Quay can be integrated with Tekton pipelines to trigger application rebuilds when images are updated in the Red Hat container catalog. At a high level, the flow will look like this: medium: Securing Containers with Red Hat Quay and Clair \u2014 Part I Application Migration Toolkit Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit is an assembly of open source tools that enables large-scale application migrations and modernizations.

OpenShift Container Platform uses the Multus CNI plug-in to allow chaining of CNI plug-ins. During cluster installation, you configure your default Pod network. The default network handles all ordinary network traffic for the cluster. You can define an additional network based on the available CNI plug-ins and attach one or more of these networks to your Pods. You can define more than one additional network for your cluster, depending on your needs. This gives you flexibility when you configure Pods that deliver network functionality, such as switching or routing. You can use an additional network in situations where network isolation is needed, including data plane and control plane separation. Isolating network traffic is useful for the following performance and security reasons: Performance: You can send traffic on two different planes in order to manage how much traffic is along each plane. Security: You can send sensitive traffic onto a network plane that is managed specifically for security considerations, and you can separate private data that must not be shared between tenants or customers. All of the Pods in the cluster still use the cluster-wide default network to maintain connectivity across the cluster. Every Pod has an eth0 interface that is attached to the cluster-wide Pod network. You can view the interfaces for a Pod by using the oc exec -it \u2013 ip a command. If you add additional network interfaces that use Multus CNI, they are named net1, net2, \u2026\u200b, netN. To attach additional network interfaces to a Pod, you must create configurations that define how the interfaces are attached. You specify each interface by using a Custom Resource (CR) that has a NetworkAttachmentDefinition type.

An image stream is an abstraction for referencing container images from within OpenShift while the referenced images are an image registry such as OpenShift internal registry, Quay, or other external registries. Image streams are capable of defining triggers which allow your builds and deployments to be automatically invoked when a new version of an image is available in the backing image registry. This in effect enables rebuilding all images that are based on a particular base image as soon as a new version of the base image is available in the Red Hat container catalog and therefore updates all images with the latest bug, CVE, and vulnerability fixes delivered in the latest base image. The challenge, however, is that this capability is limited to BuildConfigs in OpenShift and does not allow more complex workflows to be triggered when images are updated in the Red Hat container catalog. Furthermore, it is also limited to the scope of a single cluster and its internal OpenShift registry. Fortunately, though, using Red Hat Quay as a central registry in combination with OpenShift Pipelines enables infinite possibilities in designing sophisticated workflows for ensuring a secure software supply chain and automatically performing any set of actions whenever images are pushed, updated, or security vulnerabilities are discovered in the Red Hat container catalog. In this blog post, we will highlight how Red Hat Quay can be integrated with Tekton pipelines to trigger application rebuilds when images are updated in the Red Hat container catalog.

Declarative Pipeline is a relatively recent addition to Jenkins Pipeline which presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems. Jenkinsfiles have only become an integral part of Jenkins since version 2 but they have quickly become the de-facto standard for building continuous delivery pipelines with Jenkins. Jenkinsfile allows defining pipelines as code using a Groovy DSL syntax and checking it into source version control which allows you to track, review, audit, and manage the lifecycle of changes to the continuous delivery pipelines the same way that you manage the source code of your application. Although the Groovy DSL syntax which is referred to as the scripted syntax is the more well-known and established syntax for building Jenkins pipelines and was the default when Jenkins 2 was released , support for a newer declarative syntax is also added since Jenkins 2.5 in order to offer a simplified way for controlling all aspects of the pipeline. Although the scripted and declarative syntax provides two ways to define your pipeline, they both translate to the same execution blocks in Jenkins and achieve the same result. The declarative syntax in its simplest form is composed of an agent which defines the Jenkins slave to be used for executing the pipeline and a number of stages and each stage with a number of steps to be performed.

Security Context Constraints Dzone: Understanding OpenShift Security Context Constraints Review Security Context Constraints Security Context Constraints (SCCs) control what actions pods can perform and what resources they can access. SCCs combine a set of security configurations into a single policy object that can be applied to pods. These security configurations include, but are not limited to, Linux Capabilities, Seccomp Profiles, User and Group ID Ranges, and types of mounts. OpenShift ships with several SCCs. The most constrained is the restricted SCC, and the least constrained in the privileged SCC. The other SCCs provide intermediate levels of constraint for various use cases. The restricted SCC is granted to all authenticated users by default. The default SCC for most pods should be the restricted SCC. If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different SCCs. Pods should be run with the most restrictive SCC possible. Pods inherit their SCC from the Service Account used to run the pod. With the default project template, new projects get a Service Account named default that is used to run pods. This default service account is only granted the ability to run the restricted SCC. Recommendations: Use OpenShift\u2019s Security Context Constraint feature, which has been contributed to Kubernetes as Pod Security Policies . PSPs are still beta in Kubernetes 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12. Use the restricted SCC as the default For pods that require additional access, use the SCC that grants the least amount of additional privileges or create a custom SCC Audit To show all available SCCs: oc describe scc To audit a single pod: oc describe pod <POD> | grep openshift.io\\/scc Remediation: Apply the SCC with the least privilege required OpenShift Network Model & Network Policy docs.openshift.com: Understanding networking docs.openshift.com: Configuring network policy with OpenShift SDN NetworkPolicies and Microsegmentation Fully Automated Management of Egress IPs with the egressip-ipam-operator \ud83c\udf1f GitHub: redhat-cop OpenShift Toolkit Network Policy \ud83c\udf1f redhat.com: Network traffic control for containers in Red Hat OpenShift \ud83c\udf1f Network Security Zones stackoverflow.com: Is that possible to deploy an openshift or kubernetes in DMZ zone? \ud83c\udf1f OpenShift and Network Security Zones: Coexistence Approaches \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f Introduction: Kubernetes and consequently OpenShift adopt a flat Software Defined Network (SDN) model , which means that all pods in the SDN are in the same logical network. Traditional network implementations adopt a zoning model in which different networks or zones are dedicated to specific purposes, with very strict communication rules between each zone. When implementing OpenShift in organizations that are using network security zones, the two models may clash. In this article, we will analyze a few options for coexistence. But first, let\u2019s understand the two network models a bit more in depth. Network Zones have been the widely accepted approach for building security into a network architecture. The general idea is to create separate networks, each with a specific purpose. Each network contains devices with similar security profiles. Communications between networks is highly scrutinized and controlled by firewall rules ( perimeter defense ). Conclusion: A company\u2019s security organization must be involved when deciding how to deploy OpenShift with regard to traditional network zones. Depending on their level of comfort with new technologies you may have different options. If physical network separation is the only acceptable choice, you will have to build a cluster per network zone. If logical network type of separations can be considered, then there are ways to stretch a single OpenShift deployment across multiple network zones. This post presented a few technical approaches.

SCCs combine a set of security configurations into a single policy object that can be applied to pods. These security configurations include, but are not limited to, Linux Capabilities, Seccomp Profiles, User and Group ID Ranges, and types of mounts. OpenShift ships with several SCCs. The most constrained is the restricted SCC, and the least constrained in the privileged SCC. The other SCCs provide intermediate levels of constraint for various use cases. The restricted SCC is granted to all authenticated users by default. The default SCC for most pods should be the restricted SCC. If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different SCCs. Pods should be run with the most restrictive SCC possible. Pods inherit their SCC from the Service Account used to run the pod. With the default project template, new projects get a Service Account named default that is used to run pods. This default service account is only granted the ability to run the restricted SCC. Recommendations: Use OpenShift\u2019s Security Context Constraint feature, which has been contributed to Kubernetes as Pod Security Policies . PSPs are still beta in Kubernetes 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12. Use the restricted SCC as the default For pods that require additional access, use the SCC that grants the least amount of additional privileges or create a custom SCC Audit To show all available SCCs: oc describe scc To audit a single pod: oc describe pod <POD> | grep openshift.io\\/scc Remediation: Apply the SCC with the least privilege required","title":"Review Security Context Constraints"},{"location":"openshift/#openshift-network-model-network-policy","text":"docs.openshift.com: Understanding networking docs.openshift.com: Configuring network policy with OpenShift SDN NetworkPolicies and Microsegmentation Fully Automated Management of Egress IPs with the egressip-ipam-operator \ud83c\udf1f GitHub: redhat-cop OpenShift Toolkit Network Policy \ud83c\udf1f redhat.com: Network traffic control for containers in Red Hat OpenShift \ud83c\udf1f","title":"OpenShift Network Model &amp; Network Policy"},{"location":"openshift/#network-security-zones","text":"stackoverflow.com: Is that possible to deploy an openshift or kubernetes in DMZ zone? \ud83c\udf1f OpenShift and Network Security Zones: Coexistence Approaches \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f Introduction: Kubernetes and consequently OpenShift adopt a flat Software Defined Network (SDN) model , which means that all pods in the SDN are in the same logical network. Traditional network implementations adopt a zoning model in which different networks or zones are dedicated to specific purposes, with very strict communication rules between each zone. When implementing OpenShift in organizations that are using network security zones, the two models may clash. In this article, we will analyze a few options for coexistence. But first, let\u2019s understand the two network models a bit more in depth. Network Zones have been the widely accepted approach for building security into a network architecture. The general idea is to create separate networks, each with a specific purpose. Each network contains devices with similar security profiles. Communications between networks is highly scrutinized and controlled by firewall rules ( perimeter defense ). Conclusion: A company\u2019s security organization must be involved when deciding how to deploy OpenShift with regard to traditional network zones. Depending on their level of comfort with new technologies you may have different options. If physical network separation is the only acceptable choice, you will have to build a cluster per network zone. If logical network type of separations can be considered, then there are ways to stretch a single OpenShift deployment across multiple network zones.

La arquitectura de Prometheus se basa en \u201cpull metrics\u201d (extracci\u00f3n de m\u00e9tricas) . En lugar de empujar las m\u00e9tricas (\u201cpushing metrics\u201d) hacia la herramienta de monitorizaci\u00f3n, extrae (\u201cpull\u201d) las m\u00e9tricas de los servicios (por defecto un \u201c/metrics\u201d HTTP endpoint) en texto plano (parseable por humanos y de f\u00e1cil diagn\u00f3stico). Prometheus tambi\u00e9n tiene un \u201cpush gateway\u201d, de modo que tambi\u00e9n soporta \u201cpush\u201d para m\u00e9tricas espec\u00edficas cuando el modelo de \u201cpull\u201d no funciona (si bien este m\u00e9todo no es recomendable). Prometheus se puede conectar a series de tiempo (time series) con un nombre de m\u00e9trica y pares clave-valor, simplificando la monitorizaci\u00f3n en complejos entornos cloud multi-nodo. La herramienta tambi\u00e9n proporciona PromQL , para el procesado de datos \u201ctime-series\u201d. Permite realizar consultas (queries) para la manipulaci\u00f3n de datos y generar nueva informaci\u00f3n relevante. Con PromQL se pueden generar gr\u00e1ficos, visualizar conjuntos de datos, crear tablas, y generar alertas basadas en par\u00e1metros espec\u00edficos. La consola web de Prometheus permite gestionar todas las caracter\u00edsticas y herramientas disponibles en Prometheus. Se pueden utilizar expresiones regulares y consultas avanzadas de PromQL para la creaci\u00f3n de conjuntos de datos (datasets) y alertas. Prometheus activamente \u201cscrapea\u201d datos, los almacena, y soporta \u201cqueries\u201d, \u201cgr\u00e1ficos\u201d y \u201calertas\u201d, as\u00ed como proporciona \u201cendpoints\u201d a otros consumidores API como Grafana. Todo esto lo realiza con los siguientes componentes: Librer\u00edas cliente : instrumentaci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo de aplicaci\u00f3n (para generar eventos). Servidor Prometheus : \u201cscrapeando\u201d y almacenando estos eventos, cuando se generan, como \u201ctime series data\u201d. Este es el modelo \u201cpull\u201d m\u00e1s com\u00fan para la recogida general de m\u00e9tricas en Prometheus. Pushgateway : Modelo \u201cPush\u201d , soportando trabajos ef\u00edmeros de importaci\u00f3n de datos. S\u00f3lo recomendable en aplicaciones \u201cserverless\u201d , donde las aplicaciones son lanzadas y destruidas bajo demanda, as\u00ed como las aplicaciones que manejan \u201cbatch jobs\u201d. Exportadores de Datos : exportando servicios como HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite, etc. Prometheus se diferencia de otros sistemas de monitorizaci\u00f3n con las siguientes funcionalidades: Modelo de datos multi-dimensional, donde los \u201ctime-series data\u201d se definen por el nombre de la m\u00e9trica y dimensiones clave/valor. Nodos \u00fanicos de servidor y aut\u00f3nomos, sin dependencia de almacenamiento distribuido.

Scalability, High Availability (HA) and Long-Term Storage Prometheus fue dise\u00f1ado para ser f\u00e1cil de desplegar. Es extremadamente f\u00e1cil ponerlo en marcha, recoger algunas m\u00e9tricas, y empezar a construir nuestra propia herramienta de monitorizaci\u00f3n. Las cosas se complican cuando se intenta operar a un nivel de escalado considerable. Para entender si esto va a ser un problema, conviene plantearse las siguiente preguntas: \u00bfCu\u00e1ntas m\u00e9tricas puede ingerir el sistema de monitorizaci\u00f3n y cu\u00e1ntas son necesarias? \u00bfCu\u00e1l es la cardinalidad de las m\u00e9tricas? La cardinalidad es el n\u00famero de etiquetas que cada m\u00e9trica puede tener. Es una cuesti\u00f3n muy frecuente en las m\u00e9tricas pertenecientes a entornos din\u00e1micos donde a los contenedores se les asignan un ID \u00f3 nombre diferente cada vez que son lanzados, reiniciados o movidos entre nodos (caso de kubernetes). \u00bfEs necesaria la Alta Disponibilidad (HA)? \u00bfDurante cu\u00e1nto tiempo es necesario mantener las m\u00e9tricas y con qu\u00e9 resoluci\u00f3n? La implementaci\u00f3n de HA es laboriosa porque la funcionalidad de cluster requiere a\u00f1adir plugins de terceros al servidor Prometheus. Es necesario tratar con \u201cbackups\u201d y \u201crestores\u201d, y el almacenamiento de m\u00e9tricas por un periodo de tiempo extendido har\u00e1 que la base de datos crezca exponencialmente. Los servidores Prometheus proporcionan almacenamiento persistente, pero Prometheus no fue creado para el almacenamiento distribuido de m\u00e9tricas a lo largo de m\u00faltiples nodos de un cluster con replicaci\u00f3n y capacidad curativa (como es el caso de Kubernetes). Esto es conocido como \u201calmacenamiento a largo-plazo\u201d (Long-Term) y actualmente es un requisito en unos pocos casos de uso, por ejemplo en la planificaci\u00f3n de la capacidad para monitorizar c\u00f3mo la infraestructura necesita evolucionar, contracargos para facturar diferentes equipos \u00f3 departamentos para un caso espec\u00edfico que han hecho de la infraestructura, an\u00e1lisis de tendencias de uso, o adherirse a regulaciones para verticales espec\u00edficos como banca, seguros, etc. Storage Solutions for Prometheus monitoring2.substack.com: Big Prometheus.

Red Hat AMQ Broker is based on ActiveMQ Artemis, being this the reason why one of the following proof of concepts is done with Artemis (the other one was run in order to learn telegraf, prometheus and grafana). The same solution tested with Artemis on RHEL is valid for Red Hat AMQ 7 Broker on RHEL. Red Hat AMQ 7 Broker is OpenShift 3.11 compliant as Technical Preview and deployed as Operator. Red Hat AMQ 7 Operator is fully supported in OpenShift 4.x, initially with Prometheus and Grafana monitoring already setup and maintained by AMQ Operator. It is recommended to check the metrics collected and displayed by AMQ Operator with another Proof of Concept in OpenShift 4.x.

La arquitectura de Prometheus se basa en \u201cpull metrics\u201d (extracci\u00f3n de m\u00e9tricas) . En lugar de empujar las m\u00e9tricas (\u201cpushing metrics\u201d) hacia la herramienta de monitorizaci\u00f3n, extrae (\u201cpull\u201d) las m\u00e9tricas de los servicios (por defecto un \u201c/metrics\u201d HTTP endpoint) en texto plano (parseable por humanos y de f\u00e1cil diagn\u00f3stico). Prometheus tambi\u00e9n tiene un \u201cpush gateway\u201d, de modo que tambi\u00e9n soporta \u201cpush\u201d para m\u00e9tricas espec\u00edficas cuando el modelo de \u201cpull\u201d no funciona (si bien este m\u00e9todo no es recomendable). Prometheus se puede conectar a series de tiempo (time series) con un nombre de m\u00e9trica y pares clave-valor, simplificando la monitorizaci\u00f3n en complejos entornos cloud multi-nodo. La herramienta tambi\u00e9n proporciona PromQL , para el procesado de datos \u201ctime-series\u201d. Permite realizar consultas (queries) para la manipulaci\u00f3n de datos y generar nueva informaci\u00f3n relevante. Con PromQL se pueden generar gr\u00e1ficos, visualizar conjuntos de datos, crear tablas, y generar alertas basadas en par\u00e1metros espec\u00edficos. La consola web de Prometheus permite gestionar todas las caracter\u00edsticas y herramientas disponibles en Prometheus. Se pueden utilizar expresiones regulares y consultas avanzadas de PromQL para la creaci\u00f3n de conjuntos de datos (datasets) y alertas. Prometheus activamente \u201cscrapea\u201d datos, los almacena, y soporta \u201cqueries\u201d, \u201cgr\u00e1ficos\u201d y \u201calertas\u201d, as\u00ed como proporciona \u201cendpoints\u201d a otros consumidores API como Grafana. Todo esto lo realiza con los siguientes componentes: Librer\u00edas cliente : instrumentaci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo de aplicaci\u00f3n (para generar eventos). Servidor Prometheus : \u201cscrapeando\u201d y almacenando estos eventos, cuando se generan, como \u201ctime series data\u201d. Este es el modelo \u201cpull\u201d m\u00e1s com\u00fan para la recogida general de m\u00e9tricas en Prometheus. Pushgateway : Modelo \u201cPush\u201d , soportando trabajos ef\u00edmeros de importaci\u00f3n de datos. S\u00f3lo recomendable en aplicaciones \u201cserverless\u201d , donde las aplicaciones son lanzadas y destruidas bajo demanda, as\u00ed como las aplicaciones que manejan \u201cbatch jobs\u201d. Exportadores de Datos : exportando servicios como HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite, etc. Prometheus se diferencia de otros sistemas de monitorizaci\u00f3n con las siguientes funcionalidades: Modelo de datos multi-dimensional, donde los \u201ctime-series data\u201d se definen por el nombre de la m\u00e9trica y dimensiones clave/valor. Nodos \u00fanicos de servidor y aut\u00f3nomos, sin dependencia de almacenamiento distribuido. Recogida de datos via un modelo \u201cpull\u201d sobre HTTP. \u201cTime Series Data\u201d empujado (\u201cpushed\u201d) a otros destinos de datos v\u00eda un gateway intermediario. \u201cTargets\u201d descubiertos via \u201cservice discovery\u201d \u00f3 configuraci\u00f3n est\u00e1tica.

Las cosas se complican cuando se intenta operar a un nivel de escalado considerable. Para entender si esto va a ser un problema, conviene plantearse las siguiente preguntas: \u00bfCu\u00e1ntas m\u00e9tricas puede ingerir el sistema de monitorizaci\u00f3n y cu\u00e1ntas son necesarias? \u00bfCu\u00e1l es la cardinalidad de las m\u00e9tricas?

Kubernetes is the leader in container orchestration. It offers teams the flexibility to efficiently run containerized workloads across multiple public cloud providers and hybrid cloud environments. Kubernetes offers advanced scheduling and scaling capabilities to ensure application performance and high availability. However, its functionality focuses on managing resources within a single cluster. Rancher, on the other hand, is a platform designed to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters. It eases Kubernetes cluster management in large environments in several ways. For example, Rancher simplifies operations such as cluster provisioning, centralized security management, and monitoring workloads using popular tools such as Prometheus.

Rancher.com: Setup a basic Kubernetes cluster with ease using RKE Bootstrap RKE Kubernetes Cluster in AWS Environment K3S k3s Basic kubernetes with automated installer. Lightweight Kubernetes Distribution. K8s vs k3s \u201cK3s is designed to be a single binary of less than 40MB that completely implements the Kubernetes API. In order to achieve this, they removed a lot of extra drivers that didn\u2019t need to be part of the core and are easily replaced with add-ons. K3s is a fully CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) certified Kubernetes offering. This means that you can write your YAML to operate against a regular \u201cfull-fat\u201d Kubernetes and they\u2019ll also apply against a k3s cluster. Due to its low resource requirements, it\u2019s possible to run a cluster on anything from 512MB of RAM machines upwards. This means that we can allow pods to run on the master, as well as nodes. And of course, because it\u2019s a tiny binary, it means we can install it in a fraction of the time it takes to launch a regular Kubernetes cluster! We generally achieve sub-two minutes to launch a k3s cluster with a handful of nodes, meaning you can be deploying apps to learn/test at the drop of a hat.\u201d k3sup (said \u2018ketchup\u2019) is a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM.

It is specifically designed to only have what is needed to run k3s. Additionally the OS is designed to be managed by kubectl once a cluster is bootstrapped. Nodes only need to join a cluster and then all aspects of the OS can be managed from Kubernetes. Both k3OS and k3s upgrades are handled by the k3OS operator. K3OS Value Add : Supports multiple architectures K3OS runs on x86 and ARM processors to give you maximum flexibility. Runs only the minimum required services Fewer services means a tiny attack surface, for greater security. Doesn\u2019t require a package manager The required services are built into the distribution image. Models infrastructure as code Manage system configuration with version control systems. K3C K3C Lightweight local container engine for container development. K3C is a local container engine designed to fill the same gap Docker does in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Specifically k3c focuses on developing and running local containers, basically docker run/build. Currently k3s, the lightweight Kubernetes distribution , provides a great solution for Kubernetes from dev to production. While k3s satisifies the Kubernetes runtime needs, one still needs to run docker (or a docker-like tool) to actually develop and build the container images. k3c is intended to replace docker for just the functionality needed for the Kubernetes ecosystem.

Lightweight Kubernetes Distribution. K8s vs k3s \u201cK3s is designed to be a single binary of less than 40MB that completely implements the Kubernetes API. In order to achieve this, they removed a lot of extra drivers that didn\u2019t need to be part of the core and are easily replaced with add-ons. K3s is a fully CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) certified Kubernetes offering. This means that you can write your YAML to operate against a regular \u201cfull-fat\u201d Kubernetes and they\u2019ll also apply against a k3s cluster. Due to its low resource requirements, it\u2019s possible to run a cluster on anything from 512MB of RAM machines upwards. This means that we can allow pods to run on the master, as well as nodes. And of course, because it\u2019s a tiny binary, it means we can install it in a fraction of the time it takes to launch a regular Kubernetes cluster! We generally achieve sub-two minutes to launch a k3s cluster with a handful of nodes, meaning you can be deploying apps to learn/test at the drop of a hat.\u201d k3sup (said \u2018ketchup\u2019) is a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM.
